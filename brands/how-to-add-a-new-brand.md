# How to add a new Brand

### **Overview / Purpose**

This section describes how to create **agencies and brands** within Tourpaq. Proper creation ensures that bookings, users, and payment rules are correctly associated with the respective brand and agency.

Only users with the **Super Administrator** role can initially create a company’s first agency and brand. After the first brand and admin user are established, company administrators can also create additional brands and users.

### **How It Works**

1. The **Super Administrator** accesses the **Companies menu**.
2. Select the company where the new agency will belong.
3. Create the agency with its metadata (name, contact info, template selection).
4. Once the agency exists, brands can be created and linked to it.
5. After the first brand and admin user exist, **administrators** of that company gain the ability to create further brands and users.

### **Examples / Scenarios**

1. **Initial Setup**
   * Super Administrator creates the first agency “Tourpaq DK” for a company and links the first brand.
2. **Subsequent Brands**
   * A company administrator adds a new brand “Tourpaq Travel” after the first brand and admin user are created.
3. **Adding Users**
   * Once the first brand is established, admins create user accounts for staff, assigning them to the correct agency/brand.

### **Notes / Best Practices**

* Only a **Super Administrator** can create the first agency and brand for a company.
* Ensure **all required fields** (name, email, phone, address, template) are completed to prevent configuration errors.
* Verify **booking ID ranges and payment rules** after brand creation to avoid misassigned bookings.
* After the first brand and admin user are set up, **administrators can manage brand/user creation**, reducing reliance on Super Administrators.
