### Image Fields

| Field              | Description                                                                        | Usage                                                                             |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Logo**           | The main logo for the booking website. It is usually placed in the page header.    | Recommended to use a transparent background (PNG) for a clean look.               |
| **Preloader**      | An image that appears while the booking page content is loading.                   | Typically a lightweight animated or static image like a beach ball, spinner, etc. |
| **Piticons**       | Custom icons for product or service categories displayed in the web booking flow.  | Used to visually differentiate categories; keep icons simple and consistent.      |
| **Footer Logo**    | A logo that appears in the footer section of the booking page.                     | It can differ from the main logo if needed for style purposes.                    |
| **Favicon**        | The small icon that appears in the browser tab next to the page title.             | Upload a small-sized, square icon (usually 16x16 or 32x32 pixels).                |
| **Support Person** | An image representing customer support, shown next to help or contact information. | Should be a friendly and welcoming image to encourage user interaction.           |

### Upload Instructions

* **Click** on the dashed box ("Click to browse or drag and drop here") to open a file browser and select an image.
* **Drag and Drop** the image file directly into the dashed box.
* Images should be **optimized** for web (small file sizes) to ensure fast page loading.

#### Recommended Formats:

* **PNG** for logos and icons (preferred for transparency).
* **JPEG** for photos (like support person images) where transparency is not needed.
* **ICO** for favicon (or PNG if supported).

#### Size Recommendations:

* **Logo**: \~250px width (responsive)
* **Preloader**: Small and lightweight (\~100x100px or less)
* **Piticons**: \~50x50px
* **Footer Logo**: Similar size to main logo but adjusted for footer styling
* **Favicon**: 16x16px or 32x32px
* **Support Person**: 200x200px or proportional depending on layout

## Notes:

* Replacing an existing image automatically updates the website; no need to manually clear cache unless instructed.
* If no image is uploaded for a field, a default placeholder or no image may appear.
* Maintain a consistent visual style (e.g., color palette, shape) across all uploaded images for a professional appearance.
