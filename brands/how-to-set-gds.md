In the GDS tab you can add various info texts related to the status of GDS.&#x20;

* Text to add on ticket â€“ text from this box will be added on the ticket, at the bottom of the "Betalingplan" section. If you want this text to be bold on the ticket, select the checkbox.&#x20;

Next I will fill in the info text that will appear depending on the status of the booking from the Galileo provider:&#x20;

* Galileo pending: this text will appear when the booking is pending. Passengers will see this text when booking is in pending status.&#x20;
* The same idea is when the booking will be in the other status: HK (Hold & Confirm), TKQ (Ticket Queue), or TKOK (Ticket OK). Passengers will see the following message regarding the status of their booking and what they will do next.&#x20;

Click Save GDS.
