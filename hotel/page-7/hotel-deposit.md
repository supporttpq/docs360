It can be set in the _Hotel/Deposit_ tab.

A deposit needs the following fields to be set:

* Deposit date - the date on when the invoice is generated
* Payment type - it's an autofill field
* Amount - the amount paid
* Payback date - the date when the payment is made At the final payment, the deposit is deducted from the hotel invoice, only if it's in the paid status.

Deposits are paid at a date agreed upon in the contract between companies/agencies and creditors

A new function has been added here, **Special deposit rule**. It is used to precalculate the deposit amount for more deposit dates. It requires allotments and costs of the rooms to be set in the hotel.
