Hotel Allotments are created from the **Hotel/All** tab by using the **Create** button.

The room availability is set from **Period Start** and **Period Stop**.

**Room** dropdown allows to select the room type.

**No.** box allows the insertion of available room quantity

**Guaranteed** box is the number of rooms that are paid even if they are not booked. These rooms are marked in the booking process and should be sold first.

To finish the process, press **Save**

Rooms cannot be used in bookings unless the allotment is generated.

The **Extend** button allows the room's availability period to be extended without creating a new line. Just insert the **Period stop** new date and press **Extend**.

#### Hotel allotment control <a href="#hotel-allotment-control" id="hotel-allotment-control"></a>

The hotel allotment can be controlled/limited per transport. The bellow part of the printscreen is made from the pricelist rule of the specified transport.

In the above example, the room has 20 total available allotments.  For a particular transport, there is a max allotment limit set of 5, and 3 rooms have already been sold. This means that for this transport, the available rooms left number is 1. For other transports, it's all or the specific limit for that transport as well.

#### Generate all allotments

This feature will help us to generate all allotments at once and not doing it for each one at a time.&#x20;

There are cases when you have many allotments to generate for a hotel. Instead of click on each one individually, now you're able to generate all at once, by using generate all button and then click OK if you agree to generate.
