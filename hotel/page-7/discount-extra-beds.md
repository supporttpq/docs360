&#x20;It should be possible to define as many discounts as possible. An extra bed discount will be defined by the following values:

* Set the age for which the discount is applied. This format is set for children.&#x20;
* Set the start date and end date in which the discount is applied.&#x20;
* Set the value of the discount.&#x20;
* Discount 2nd column is the discount for the second extra bed in a room. Use it if you want to have separate discounts. The same thing is for discount 3rd.&#x20;
* The percent check box turns the discount into a percentage. Like this, the discount will be 10%.&#x20;
* FHC - Extra bed calculated from profit. This feature works with Price Margin Service
* H - is Hidden: Average Discount/Pax/Room is added to each passenger in room
* HP - hotel price: percent from hotel price
* PD - Per day: is per day - if is marked, this makes the value be applied per day and not per interval
* Room type - from here you can select the room for which the discount is applied.&#x20;
* Transports - from here you can select transports for which the discount can apply.&#x20;
* Period - from here you select the periods. The periods are the intervals in the transport.&#x20;
