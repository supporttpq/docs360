# Add room cost rule with "Per Room Per Stay" with a specific stay days value

### ‚úÖ Overview

This page outlines how to **configure and test hotel room cost rules** in the booking system. You'll learn how to define cost rules based on stay intervals, validate that they apply correctly to bookings, and observe how they respond to different travel intervals.

The process is used to ensure that only **valid, matching cost rules** are applied to bookings and that mismatches result in no costs being allocated.

***

### üéØ Purpose

The goal of this workflow is to:

* Ensure that room cost rules apply **only** when booking intervals match their configured periods.
* Validate that rule changes take effect without system errors.
* Confirm that the system correctly **includes or excludes costs** based on input data.

This testing is important to guarantee **financial accuracy** and **logic reliability** when travel agents or systems create real bookings.

Before beginning this test, ensure:

* You have access to the **Hotel** and **Booking** modules.
* A hotel is available in the system.
