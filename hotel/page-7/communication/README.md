# Communication

### Overview

The **Communication** feature allows you to configure automated emails with booking lists for a specific hotel. These reports can be scheduled to run at regular intervals and sent directly to one or more email addresses.

### Purpose

This functionality ensures hotels and agencies receive timely updates about bookings. Automating report delivery eliminates manual report generation, improves communication, and helps partners plan arrivals and manage availability more efficiently.
