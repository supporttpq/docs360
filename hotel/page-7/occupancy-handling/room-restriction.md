# Room Restriction

The Room Restriction feature allows hotels to limit specific bed combinations for each Base Room Type.

How It Works A new "Restrictions" section is added to the Base Room Type settings. This section displays all possible bed configurations, including ordinary beds, extra beds, and extra child beds. Users can disable certain combinations by selecting the restriction checkbox. Restricted combinations will not be available for booking or offers. Example: For a room with 2 beds, 1 extra bed, and 1 extra child bed, users can restrict certain configurations, preventing them from being booked.

This ensures that hotels can customize bed availability per room type and maintain control over occupancy rules.

Room restrictions can be configured in the Base Room Type under Hotel → Base Room Types → Edit,

&#x20;as well as in the Hotel Room under Hotel → Room Types → Edit.

Base Room Type rules apply by default unless Hotel Room Type rules are set. Base Room rules do not override Hotel Room rules.
