# Single Room Cost

In the Room Cost tab (Hotel -> Room Costs), you can specify the cost for a single-occupancy room.

* A new column, "SINGLE PRICE", is available, where you can enter the additional cost for a single occupant.
* A new column, "SP%", allows you to specify whether the single supplement is a percentage of the room cost.

The system now includes logic to support the single-occupancy cost calculation.
