# Occupancy / Handling

## Feature

Occupancy handling is a feature that enables hotels to define flexible pricing and occupancy rules for their rooms. This feature provides comprehensive support for single-room pricing, varying occupancy limits for the same room type, and customizable room restrictions to enhance the booking experience.

* This feature has to be activated "per company".

Key Functionalities:

* **Room Restrictions**: Allows hotels to define which bed combinations are allowed per room, preventing unsupported configurations from being booked.
* **Single Room Cost**: Enables pricing adjustments for single occupancy, either as a fixed amount or as a percentage supplement.
* **Flexible Occupancy Limits**: Supports different maximum occupancy settings for the same room type, ensuring accurate room availability management.
* **Single Room Supplement**: Automatically applies a supplement when a double room is booked for single use, with configurable pricing rules.

These capabilities ensure better flexibility and control over room offerings, making it easier for Bravo Tours to manage their hotel inventory efficiently.
