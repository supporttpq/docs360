# Exclusive start date for hotels

To have access to this option, the "Room occupancy" feature must first be activated by a superadmin.

The Exclusive start date option can be found in Hotel -> Allotment per day -> Search with Allotment Control. This feature allows an agency to reserve some rooms for guests on specific days, independent of the transport.\
A destination may have several transports during a week, and they need to reserve some rooms for the arrivals on Friday. The reservation must be independent of the transport, as they may have more than one arrival on the same day, and they do not care if the guests arrive via one or the other transport.

The reservation of rooms is also needed based on the duration of the stay. They need this to reserve a few rooms for longer stays, or maybe the other way around.

For every possible duration (intervals for the eligible transports), it shall be possible to reserve a number of rooms for a specific arrival day. If there are three transports with arrival on Friday, and they represent durations of 5, 7, and 14 days, then we have the possibility to reserve rooms for this day for each duration.

#### Add values for departure intervals and check if the booking availability updates
