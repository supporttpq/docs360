# Allotments per day

This tab is used to monitor and control the hotel allotments, either by changing the number of total available rooms, or by modifying the number of rooms available for transports.

From the "NO.RMS" column, the number of available rooms can be changed (increased or decreased). Also, we can change the number of rooms by inserting a value in the change values fields and then clicking Apply.

Secured rooms are rooms secured, not paid, and no stop sale can be added.

Guaranteed Rooms represents the number of rooms that are paid for even if they are not booked. These rooms are marked in the booking process and should be sold first. Click update.

Search with allotment control we'll search on departure date, this way you can control how many rooms that are to be sold on each departure per flight.

At each transport, we notice 2 columns marked with R and B.

R represents the set allotment and

B are booked rooms on flight.

In the transport columns, the number of rooms available for booking on that transport for a specific interval can be controlled.

Control status:

-1 = there is no room limit that can be sold on this transport

0 = no rooms can be sold on this transport

1+ = total number of rooms that can be sold on that specific transport
