# Hotel release - Reporting

### Overview

The **Hotel Release Reporting Scheduler** is a set of configurable rules that are executed periodically by a Windows service. The scheduler automates the release of hotel rooms according to the rules defined in Tourpaq Office, ensuring timely notifications to suppliers and proper management of allotments.

### Purpose

The scheduler allows administrators to:

* Automate hotel room release reports on a daily, weekly, monthly, or annual basis.
* Ensure consistent and timely execution of release rules.
* Reduce manual work for hotel release management.

### How to Add a New Rule

To configure a release reporting rule for a hotel:

1. Navigate to **Dashboard ‚Üí Hotel ‚Üí Release Tab ‚Üí Scheduler**.
2. Click **Add Record** to create a new scheduler row.
3. Enter the required details for the scheduler (hotel, dates, frequency, etc.).
4. Click **Insert** to save the new scheduler row.
5. To modify an existing scheduler row, edit the row directly in the grid and click **Update** to save changes.

### Scheduler Types

**1. Daily Release Scheduler**

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (13) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Runs **every day** starting from the first execution date.
* Example:
  * Service first runs on **24.03.2025** for interval **24.03.2025 ‚Äì 31.03.2025**.
  * The rule‚Äôs allowed interval is **27.03.2025 ‚Äì 31.03.2025**, so only dates **27 ‚Äì 31.03.2025** are released.



2. Weekly Release Scheduler

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (14) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Runs **once a week** on a specific day of the week.
* Useful for hotels that want to release rooms on a consistent weekly schedule.



3. Monthly Release Scheduler

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (15) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Runs **once a month** on a specific day of the month.
* Ideal for monthly batch updates of hotel room availability.



4. Annual Release Scheduler

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (16) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Runs **once a year** for the entire specified start‚Äìend period.
* üìù **Note:** In annual mode, the **‚ÄúDays after‚Äù** field is ignored.

#### Notes

* Each scheduler is linked to a **specific hotel** and cannot apply to multiple hotels simultaneously.
* Scheduler execution is handled by the Windows service; administrators only need to configure rules in Tourpaq Office.
* Logs and reports for each run are generated automatically and can be reviewed for auditing purposes.
