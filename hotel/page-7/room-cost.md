# Room cost

**Room Cost** are rules that can apply to a specific hotel. The rule can be configured to apply for a booking in a specific departure date period, in a specific booking date period and by a room type or all room types that are assigned to the selected hotel. The amount of the **Room Cost** rule can be calculated per passenger or per room. In case the rule is configured per room the the amount will be divided between the passengers that will stay in that room.

In order to test the rule you can create a \[\[Booking]] that have selected the hotel and room type in question. Under the profit tab you can view in real time calculation of the \[\[Cost]] and \[\[Profit]] (some cost figure will take effect when the **Total Cost Service** will re-calculate the cost). In the profit tab, the Hotel Cost is represented as a single figure. Right next to it is an information icon, this will lead you to a more detailed view of how the hotel cost is calculated.

The are two rules that apply. They cannot be applied at the same time and are governed by the **IS PERCENT** check box:

* Percent - the value inserted in the PRICE case is used as a percent of the total value if the check box is used
* Price - the value inserted in the PRICE case is used as it is if the check box is not used. Also, this rule has two aditional exceptions because of the **PER ROOM** check box:
  * Per passenger - if the check box is not used
  * Per room - if the check box is used
* Customer Early booking discount - the value inserted in this case is used into the calculation of the pricelist Price. If this value is completed, the normal price will be taken into account when calculating the Profit of the room on the booking and the value for the pricelist will be taken into account when calculating the Pricelist prices.

  * contract Early Booking rule will apply first
  * and the Special Offer Early Booking rule will be applied on that result
  * **Please note**! - if the cost of a particular day would be 0 (for various reasons, may be the last 2 days of a Stay 7 pay 5 days rule) then, the adding of discount (Early booking or other) will not result in a negative amount cost but still zero.

* Percent check box (if checked it turns the value into a percent)
