# Create using wizard

### Overview

The **Add Hotel Wizard** is designed to simplify the process of creating a new hotel in the system. Instead of navigating across multiple tabs and saving several times, the wizard allows you to enter all required information on a single page.

Once saved, the hotel is automatically created, and the system redirects you to the hotel’s edit page where additional details (optional fields, contracts, supplements, etc.) can be added.

### Purpose

This functionality streamlines the hotel creation process, reduces time spent on setup, and ensures that all minimum required data is entered before the hotel is saved.

### Accessing the Wizard

1. Navigate to the **Hotel List** page.
2. Click the **Create using wizard** button.
3. The system opens the **Add Hotel Wizard** form.

### Required Fields

* **Code**\* – A unique identifier for the hotel (used internally in the system).
* **Name**\* – The official name of the hotel.
* **Resort**\* – Select the resort to which the hotel belongs.
* **Resort Name** – Optional free-text name for the resort.
* **Stars**\* – Select the hotel’s star rating (1–5, or applicable classification).
* **Contract Type**\* – Define the type of contract used with this hotel (e.g., direct contract, allotment, bed bank).
* **Rooms**\* – At least one room type must be added to complete the setup. Use **Edit** to configure available rooms.
* **Standard Room**\* – Select the room type to be used as the standard/default option for this hotel.

### Brands Assignment

At the bottom of the wizard, you can assign the hotel to specific **Tourpaq brands** (e.g., Tourpaq DK, Tourpaq SE, Tourpaq Live). By default, all are set to _Not assigned_. Assignments should be made if the hotel is to be visible and bookable under a specific brand.

### Saving

* Once all required fields are filled, click **Save**.
* The system creates the new hotel and redirects you automatically to the **Edit Hotel** page, where you can enrich the setup with further optional data (supplier, board basis, contracts, etc.).

### Example Use Case

A new hotel _Sunset Resort_ in _Agia Marina_ can be created by:

1. Entering a code (e.g., **SUNSET01**)
2. Assigning it to the resort _Agia Marina_
3. Selecting **4 stars** and contract type Allotment
4. Adding one room type (_Double Room_) and setting it as the standard room
5. Assigning it to **Tourpaq Live** brand

With these steps, the hotel is created in just one page and ready for further configuration.
