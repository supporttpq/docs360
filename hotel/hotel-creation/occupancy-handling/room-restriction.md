# Room Restriction

### Overview

The **Room Restriction** feature allows hotels to control which bed combinations are allowed for each room type. This ensures that only supported room configurations can be booked, preventing invalid or undesired occupancy setups.

### Purpose

* Customize bed availability per room type.
* Control occupancy rules and prevent unsupported combinations from being offered.
* Maintain consistency between the hotel’s actual room setup and what is available for booking.

### How It Works

* A **Restrictions** section is added to the **Hotel Room Types** settings.
* The section lists all possible bed configurations for the room type, including:
  * Ordinary beds
  * Extra beds
  * Extra child beds
* Users can **disable specific combinations** by selecting the **restriction checkbox**.
* Restricted combinations will **not be available** for booking or offers.

#### Example

For a room with:

* 2 ordinary beds
* 1 extra bed
* 1 extra child bed

The hotel can restrict certain combinations (e.g., 2 ordinary beds + 1 extra child bed only) to prevent invalid booking scenarios.

This ensures that hotels can customize bed availability per room type and control occupancy rules.

As well as in the Hotel Room under Hotel → Room Types → Edit.
