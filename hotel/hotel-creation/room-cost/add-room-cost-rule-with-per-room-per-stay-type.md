# Add room cost rule with "Per Room Per Stay" type

### Overview

This page describes the **Hotel Room Cost Rule flow.** It explains each step a user must take to configure hotel costs, verify bookings, and ensure proper cost allocation and creditor integration.

The flow is used to define, apply, and validate **cost calculation rules** for hotel bookings — ensuring consistency across invoicing, profit margins, and multi-currency accounting.

***

### Purpose

The purpose of this feature is to:

* Define how room costs are calculated for a hotel (per stay, per day, etc.)
* Ensure those costs are applied correctly to bookings
* Confirm the system calculates totals and currency conversions as expected
* Link hotel costs to creditors for accurate payment tracking

This process is essential for financial accuracy in the platform and prevents issues with supplier payouts and client billing.

***

### Preconditions

Before beginning this process:

* A hotel must already exist in the system.
* You must have permission to create and edit room cost rules.
* You should understand how bookings are structured in the system.
* Currency exchange rates should be available (for creditor validation).
