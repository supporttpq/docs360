# Early Booking Cost Discount Rule – Deletion Behavior

**Overview**

When an **Early Booking Cost Discount Rule** is deleted from a hotel, the related information in the **autobilling invoice** (specifically in the _EarlyBookingDepositInvoiceLine_ table) is also deleted.\
This behavior occurs regardless of the invoice status and is part of the current Tourpaq implementation logic.

***

**Behavior Details**

* The deletion of an **Early Booking Cost Discount Rule** triggers a **cascading delete** in Tourpaq.
* This cascade removes the related data from the **EarlyBookingDepositInvoiceLine** table.
* The behavior is **not linked to the autobilling process** or the invoice’s status — it is handled entirely within the **Tourpaq system logic**.

**The information will no longer be available.**

Note: Be aware that even though the invoice data is deleted, the sum of the invoice remains. This is expected behavior.
