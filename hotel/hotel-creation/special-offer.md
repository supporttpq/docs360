### Notes & Best Practices

* Check **Approved** before you troubleshoot pricing.
* Confirm **Booking** and **Arrival** ranges match the intended season.
* Use **Min Days** to prevent short-stay leakage.
* Use **NP** only when you mean “fixed price”, not “discount”.
* Be careful with **Unlock Service**. It can override locked values.

### FAQ

#### 1. Why is my Special Offer not applied?

**Q:** The booking matches the dates, but pricing does not change. Why?\
**A:** Check these first:

* The rule is **Approved**.
* The booking is inside **Booking Start/End** and **Arrival Start/End**.
* The room matches **Room** and the correct **Contract / Period** is selected.
* **Min Days** and **Days B. Arr** are satisfied.
* The value is configured correctly (price vs percent vs per room/pax).

#### 2. What does “Approved” mean?

**Q:** Do rules work without approval?\
**A:** Typically no. Approval is the “live” switch for the rule.

#### 3. What is the difference between NP, %, PR, and PP?

**Q:** Which checkboxes should I use for a normal discount?\
**A:** Most discounts use:

* **%** when the value is a percentage.
* **PR** when the discount is per room.
* **PP** when the discount is per passenger.
* **NP** only when the value is a price, not a discount.

#### 4. How does ATD work on Early Booking rules?

**Q:** Will my special offer replace the contract Early Booking?\
**A:** Not if **ATD** is enabled. It will stack on top of the contract rule.

#### 5. Can Early Booking and Stay & Pay be combined?

**Q:** Which rule wins if both exist?\
**A:** It depends on **EB** and **S\&P**:

* If **EB** is disabled, Early Booking wins.
* If **S\&P** is disabled, Stay & Pay wins.

#### 6. Where do notes show up?

**Q:** If I add a NOTE, who can see it?\
**A:** Notes show on Notifications and on the Hotel page.
