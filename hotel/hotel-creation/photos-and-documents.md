# Photos & Documents

#### **Overview**

The _Photos_ section allows you to upload, manage, and organize images related to a hotel. These images are used across different brands to represent the property. Correctly setting these fields ensures that customers see the most relevant and high-quality images when browsing hotels.

#### **Purpose**

* To maintain a consistent and accurate visual representation of the hotel.
* To assign titles, descriptions, and room type relevance to each photo.
* To define which image should be used as the _main photo_ in customer-facing systems.
* To ensure brand-specific visibility of images when working with multiple platforms.

#### **Fields and Instructions**

1. **Image**
   * Displays the uploaded photo.
   * Click the preview to check image quality.
   * Photos should be high-resolution and reflect the hotel accurately (e.g., lobby, rooms, pool, dining areas).
2. **Image Title**
   * A short label for the photo (e.g., _Lobby_, _Standard Room_, _Pool_).
   * Helps both internal staff and customers identify the image.
   * Use clear, professional naming (avoid generic names like "Image1").
3. **Description**
   * Optional longer text that describes the photo.
   * Example: _“Spacious standard room with king-size bed and city view.”_
   * Adds clarity for customers and improves accessibility.

5. **Is Main Photo**
   * Checkbox to mark one image as the **primary photo**.
   * The _main photo_ will be the first image customers see.
   * Only one photo should be selected per hotel setup.
6. **Room Type**
   * Links the photo to a specific room category (if applicable).
   * Options: Dropdown with values like _Unspecified_, _Standard Room_, _Suite_, etc.
   * If the photo represents a general facility (e.g., lobby, pool), leave as _Unspecified_.
7. **Delete (Trash Icon)**
   * Removes the photo from the system.
   * Use with caution, as deleted images cannot be recovered unless re-uploaded.

   * Allows you to upload a new image to the photo list.
