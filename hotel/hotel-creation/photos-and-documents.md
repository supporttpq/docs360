# Photos & Documents

#### **Overview**

The _Photos_ section allows you to upload, manage, and organize images related to a hotel. These images are used across different brands to represent the property. Correctly setting these fields ensures that customers see the most relevant and high-quality images when browsing hotels.

#### **Purpose**

* To maintain a consistent and accurate visual representation of the hotel.
* To assign titles, descriptions, and room type relevance to each photo.
* To define which image should be used as the _main photo_ in customer-facing systems.
* To ensure brand-specific visibility of images when working with multiple platforms.
