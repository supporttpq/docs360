# Photos & Documents

### Overview

The **Photos** section lets you upload, manage, and organize images for a hotel.

These images can be reused across multiple brands.

Correct setup ensures customers see the right images in lists and hotel views.

### Purpose

* Keep a consistent visual representation of the hotel.
* Add a clear title and optional description per photo.
* Link photos to a room type when relevant.
* Control which brands can show each photo.
* Pick one **main photo** for customer-facing channels.

### Documents (PDFs)

This page covers hotel **photos**.

If you need to deliver hotel-related PDF documents to customers, use [Ticket Attachments](../../email-setup/tickets-attachments/ticket-attachments.md).

If you need to attach documents to a specific booking, use [Comments](../../booking/new-booking/comments.md).
