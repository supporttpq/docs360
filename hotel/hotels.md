# Hotels

### Overview

The **Hotels** page allows administrators to manage the list of hotels available in the system. Each hotel entry can be linked to a resort, supplier, and other identifying details. These records form the foundation for building hotel contracts, assigning bookings, and integrating with suppliers or bed banks.

### Purpose

This module ensures all hotel-related information is standardized and available for booking management, reporting, and integrations with external suppliers (e.g., bed banks, Tourpaq Supplier).
