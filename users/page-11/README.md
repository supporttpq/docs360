## **Users and Roles in Tourpaq**

### **Overview / Purpose**

Tourpaq manages access to its system using **user roles**, which define what each user can view, edit, or manage. This ensures secure, role-based access and prevents unauthorized changes in bookings, payments, or configurations. Each role has its own scope of permissions, ranging from system-wide control to limited operational functions.

***

### **How It Works**

* Each user is assigned to a **company** and, optionally, one or more **agencies** within that company.
* A **role** determines the level of access. Only one role can be assigned to a user.
* Permissions can be extended through **additional rights**, which are configurable per user.
* Some roles (like Super Administrator) exist only once per Tourpaq installation, while others (like Agents, Guides, or Suppliers) can exist in multiple instances.
* User deletion is limited if the user has created bookings or financial entries.

### **Examples or Scenarios**

* A **Sales agent** uses the system to sell trips, issue tickets, and process customer payments.
* A **Supplier** logs in to adjust hotel room allotments when cancellations occur.
* A **Guide** checks which guests are arriving today, prints tickets, and sends welcome push notifications via the Guest App.

### **Notes / Best Practices**

* Always assign the **minimum role necessary** to complete a userâ€™s tasks.
* Remember: only **one Super Administrator** can exist in a system.
* **User deletion restrictions**: accounts with bookings or payments cannot be deleted.
* Use **additional rights** carefully, as they extend the power of lower-level roles (e.g., overbooking transports or hotels).
* Guides and Suppliers should only have access to the agencies or destinations relevant to their work.
* Regularly review and update user roles to match business needs and security compliance.
