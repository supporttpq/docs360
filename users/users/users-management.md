# Users Management

## **Users Dashboard ‚Äì User Management**

### **Overview / Purpose**

The **Users dashboard** provides a centralized view of all users within the agency or company. It enables administrators to manage user roles, permissions, login activity, and overall system access. This ensures secure and efficient control over who can perform specific actions in Tourpaq.

### **How It Works**

* All registered users are displayed in a **user table** with key information (username, role, company, last login, etc.).
* Administrators can **search, filter, sort, and edit** users directly from this interface.
* Actions like creating new users, blocking/unblocking, or assigning permissions are managed from the same page.
* User access can be restricted temporarily (blocked) or permanently (deleted), depending on business and security needs.

### **Examples or Scenarios**

* An **administrator** creates a new sales agent user, assigns them to a specific agency, and grants booking rights.
* A **seasonal guide** finishes their contract, so the admin **blocks** their user account instead of deleting it.
* A **financial manager** reviews the login history to check whether a team member accessed the system recently.
* An **IT administrator** filters users by role to verify which accounts still have **administrator rights**.

***

### **Notes / Best Practices**

* Always **assign the lowest necessary permissions** to reduce security risks.
* Use **block/unblock** instead of deletion when a user may return later.
* Regularly review **Last Login** data to identify inactive accounts and maintain system hygiene.
* Deletion should only be used if the user has no linked bookings or financial records.
* Consider role-based filtering to quickly audit which users have high-level access (Administrator, Financial, Super Admin).
