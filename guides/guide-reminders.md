# Guide Reminders

### **Overview**

The **Guide Reminders** module allows guides and guide team members to create, send, and track reminders within the guide organization.\
Each reminder consists of a message sent **from** one guide **to** another guide or guide team, with a defined **alarm date** and **status** to track whether the reminder is active or completed.

The page displays all reminders accessible to the logged-in user and supports filtering, reviewing past reminders, and checking the status of scheduled notifications.

Access to this menu is **restricted**. It is available **only** for the following user types:

* **Guide Master**
* **Guide Teams**
* **Sales Ledger**

Users outside these roles will not see or access the Guide Documents module.

### **Purpose**

This feature ensures that guides can coordinate tasks, share important notes, and set scheduled notifications for activities such as:

* Daily operational tasks (e.g., wake-up reminders, meeting times).
* Guest-related follow-up tasks.
* Internal communication within guide teams.
* Scheduled alerts that require action at a specific time.

By providing a reminder overview, guides can easily track what has been scheduled, what requires attention, and whether a reminder has been completed or acknowledged.
