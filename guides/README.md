# Guide Teams

##

## **Overview**

Guide Teams are used to group guides, assign them to specific resorts, control the payment methods they can use, and manage settings that directly affect the Destination App and back-office workflows.\
Each Guide Team defines:

* Which **guides** belong to it
* Which **resorts** they operate in
* Which **payment methods** they can use
* The **emails**, **guide names**, and **team members** linked to that team
* Optional overrides such as **DIBS agency rules**

This module ensures the correct distribution of responsibilities and permissions for field staff.

## **Purpose**

Creating a Guide Team allows you to:

* Organize guides into operational groups
* Control access to resorts and payment settings
* Provide the Destination App with the correct team structure
* Ensure accurate reporting in the Guide Sales Ledger
* Maintain clean coordination between back-office and on-site staff

Guide Teams are essential for large operations where each resort or region has its own dedicated staff.

## **Preconditions**

Before creating a new Guide Team, ensure:

1. The user creating the team has **administrative access** to the System Setup → Guide Teams module.
2. The guides you want to assign already exist in the system.
3. Payment methods, resorts, and user accounts are already configured (if you plan to assign them).
4. You know which guides and team members should belong to this new team.
