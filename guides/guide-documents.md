# Guide Documents

### **Overview**

The **Guide Documents** menu is a dedicated module used for storing, managing, and distributing documents needed by guide teams during daily operations. Each document can be associated with an agency, marked for guide teams, and optionally shared with customers. The page displays all uploaded files in a structured table, allowing users to quickly identify, edit, or remove guide-related materials.

Access to this menu is **restricted**. It is available **only** for the following user types:

* **Guide Master**
* **Guide Teams**
* **Sales Ledger**

Users outside these roles will not see or access the Guide Documents module.

### **Purpose**

The Guide Documents module ensures that all guides and relevant administrative teams have easy access to the latest and most accurate information for each destination or operation. Its main purposes include:

* Centralizing storage for guide-related materials (destination guides, operational instructions, excursion descriptions, safety documents, etc.)
* Ensuring guide teams receive consistent and up-to-date documentation.
* Allowing selected documents to be shared with customers when needed.
* Improving workflow efficiency by enabling quick updates, replacements, or removals of outdated documents.

By providing a structured and controlled environment for guide documentation, the system helps maintain operational accuracy, brand consistency, and communication across teams.
