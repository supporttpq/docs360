# Guide Profiles

#### **Overview**

The **Guide Profiles** section manages detailed information about guides. It includes their name, representative, title, description, contact details, and optional profile image. This section ensures that guides are correctly documented and can be easily identified and contacted.

#### **Purpose**

The purpose of the **Guide Profiles** module is to:

* Store complete contact and profile information for each guide.
* Support operations by making guide details (phone, email, emergency contact) accessible to staff.
* Provide additional guide information for customers, if required, such as descriptions or titles.
* Maintain consistency between guides’ system accounts and their personal/professional information.

***

#### **Preconditions**

* A guide account must already exist in the system (via **Guide Names**).
* The user must have permissions to edit guide profiles.
* Contact details and profile information for the guide should be available.
* A profile image is optional but recommended.
