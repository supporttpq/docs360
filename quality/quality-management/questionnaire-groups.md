### Overview

In the Tourpaq **Quality Management System**, the **Questionnaire Groups** section allows you to structure customer feedback questionnaires by themes or areas of interest. Each group corresponds to a **specific aspect of the customer's holiday experience**, enabling focused statistics and targeted quality improvements.

These groups form the **backbone of the feedback analysis system**, as they allow you to:

* Organize questions logically.
* Generate grouped reports (e.g., satisfaction with hotels vs. guides).
* Provide stakeholders with relevant insights for their specific domains.

***

### Purpose

* Group questions under a **common topic** for easier reporting.
* Allow filtering of feedback based on a specific aspect of the experience.
* Provide clearer visualization in statistical dashboards.
