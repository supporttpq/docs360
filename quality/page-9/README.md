# Quality Management

Tourpaq provides tools for calibrating the quality of the services delivered to customers. This is done by a quality management system that handles information received from the clients about the satisfaction degree they have had during their stay. Statistics are built upon these tourist feedback inputs.&#x20;

The system can send questionnaire emails to customers after a number of days from their holiday arrival.&#x20;

In this menu you can define questionnaires to gather valuable information about the customer experience and satisfaction.&#x20;

Questions can be grouped by various points of interests in a questionnaire. Statistics can be viewed based on these groups, Example: questions related to the guide experience or hotel accommodation
