# How to create a creditor

### **Overview**

The **Creditor** setup is a core prerequisite for using the **Autobilling** functionality in Tourpaq.\
A creditor represents a supplier or partner (such as a hotel, transport provider, or extras vendor) that receives automated invoices generated through the system.

Each creditor record defines financial details, contact information, and payment conditions used during invoice generation and export to the accounting system.

***

### **Purpose**

The purpose of creating a creditor is to ensure that:

* **Invoices are correctly addressed** to the right supplier.
* **Payments and exports** are handled according to accounting requirements.
* **Autobilling** can automatically generate, approve, and send invoices based on predefined rules.

Without a registered creditor, **no automated billing or export** can be performed for the associated supplier or service.

### **How It Works**

Once a creditor is created:

1. It becomes available for linking to cost items such as **hotels**, **transport**, or **extras**.
2. When a booking or service triggers an invoice, the **Autobilling engine** uses the creditor’s configuration to:
   * Generate the invoice automatically.
   * Send it to the specified **Creditor Email**.
   * Apply the **approval and payment intervals**.
   * Export it to the accounting system using the **Account Credit** and **Currency** settings.

If **Automatic Invoicing** is enabled, invoices are created without manual intervention according to the set schedule.
