* Write the department code,&#x20;
* the account debit and the account deposit. They're not mandatory, but they will be used in the invoice.&#x20;
* Select the creditor. Selecting the creditor will also automatically make the extra use of the creditor currency.&#x20;
* To activate, select the autobilling check box.&#x20;
* You can set the schedule daily, weekly, monthly, or days after the same as for a hotel.&#x20;
* You can schedule in the past the same as for the hotel.&#x20;
* Adding your schedule will use the schedule set and make a separate invoice.&#x20;
* If unchecked, the extra will be invoiced in the hotel invoice.
