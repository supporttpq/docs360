# Autobilling

Autobilling feature enables Tourpaq to generate invoices on behalf of creditors/suppliers.&#x20;

Invoice generation is done automatically based on a schedule defined for the hotels, extras, discounts, supplements, and handling and using the costs registered in the system. The system can generate the following invoice types:

* Hotel deposit invoice,&#x20;
* Hotel early booking invoice,&#x20;
* Hotel invoice,&#x20;
* Extra invoice,&#x20;
* Extra early booking invoice,&#x20;
* Transfer invoice,&#x20;
* Discount/Supplement invoice,&#x20;
* Handling invoice.&#x20;

Creditors will receive an email with the proposed invoice and, by accessing a link in the email, can accept or reject this invoice.&#x20;

Also, the invoice that are generated are shown on Finance menu/Invoice

You have the invoice number, type of the invoice, invoice name, creditor name, internal comment, amount, approved due date, and option to download the invoice. The invoice will look like this.&#x20;

We also have the option to download the accounting system export file, which will look like this.
