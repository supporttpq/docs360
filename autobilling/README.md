# Autobilling

The **Autobilling** feature allows Tourpaq to automatically generate invoices on behalf of creditors and suppliers. This automation is based on predefined schedules and cost data registered in the system, streamlining the invoicing process and reducing manual work.

#### **Automated Invoice Generation**

Tourpaq generates invoices for the following components:

* **Hotel Deposit Invoice**
* **Hotel Early Booking Invoice**
* **Hotel Invoice**
* **Extra Invoice**
* **Extra Early Booking Invoice**
* **Transfer Invoice**
* **Discount/Supplement Invoice**
* **Handling Invoice**

These invoices are generated based on configured billing schedules and use the cost values stored in the system for each relevant item (e.g., hotels, extras, supplements).

***

#### **Invoice Approval Workflow**

Once an invoice is generated:

1. The **creditor/supplier** receives an **email** with a link to review the proposed invoice.
2. By accessing the link, the creditor can **approve or reject** the invoice directly.
3. This interaction ensures that both parties have a clear and auditable trail for the invoicing process.

#### **Viewing Generated Invoices**

All generated invoices are available under the **Finance > Invoice** menu in Tourpaq.

For each invoice, the following information is displayed:

* **Invoice Number**
* **Invoice Type**
* **Invoice Name**
* **Creditor Name**
* **Internal Comment**
* **Amount**
* **Approved Due Date**
* **Download Option** (PDF format)
