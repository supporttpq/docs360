# Close Out

* Define and review **Close Out rules** that affect sales and availability.
* Filter and identify rules by date range, transport, destination, hotel, or room type.
* Confirm when and by whom rules were created.
* Quickly enable/disable rules or edit them when required.

* Close-out rules should be created carefully, as they may override availability settings in other modules.
