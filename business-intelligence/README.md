# Business Intelligence

#### **Overview**

**Business Intelligence (BI)** gives you reporting across Tourpaq modules. Use it to track sales, bookings, revenue, and capacity.

**Business Intelligence** reports read data from modules like **Bookings**, **Transport**, and **Hotels**. You scope the report using filters, then generate results.

#### **Purpose**

Use **Business Intelligence** to:

* Monitor key KPIs like sold %, occupancy, average price, and remaining capacity.
* Compare performance across periods, routes, resorts, hotels, and brands.
* Spot issues early, like stop sales, overbooking risk, or slow sales velocity.
* Export results for analysis and sharing.

#### **Key functions**

* **Reports:** Each **Business Intelligence** page focuses on a business area (flights, accommodation, allotments).
* **Filters:** Narrow results by date period and relevant dimensions (brand, resort, hotel, etc.).
* **Export:** Download results for further analysis or presentation.

#### **FAQ**

**Why is the report empty?**

Most empty reports come from filters. Check the date period first.

Also verify that the underlying setup exists for that year. Many **Business Intelligence** reports require [Departure stat weeks](../setup/departure-stat-weeks.md).

**The numbers look wrong. What should I check?**

Confirm you are filtering the intended dimension. Some reports support both **travel period** and **booking date** filtering.

Clear filters and re-run the report. Then add filters back one by one.

**I can’t see the Business Intelligence menu or a specific report. Why?**

This is usually permission-related. Ask an admin to verify your access to the Business Intelligence module.

**Why can’t I export?**

Export options can differ by report and your permissions. If the export action is missing, check your role permissions.
