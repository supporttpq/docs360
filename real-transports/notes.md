# Notes

#### Purpose

The primary purpose of the Notes section in Real Transport is to maintain an informal yet essential audit trail of route-specific decisions, temporary changes, and local airport conditions that affect the CPH-SZG route.

#### Field Breakdown

* Internal Notes Workspace: A free-text area (currently displaying "text for internal notes") designed for rapid documentation.
* Contextual Tabs: While Notes is the active area, it exists alongside General, Departures, Communication, Passenger Information, Documents, and Layout to provide a full 360-degree view of the transport route.

#### 4. Instructions&#x20;

When working in the Notes section of a Real Transport route, follow these standards:

1. Check Before Acting: Before modifying a departure or a passenger requirement, check the Notes tab to see if a colleague has already documented a pending change or a known issue.
2. Documenting "Real Transport" Events:
   * Airport Issues: Note any specific handling delays at CPH or SZG.
   * Rule Explanations: If a Transport Rule (like the BLL\_AYT example previously seen) impacts this route, explain the relationship here.
   * Testing: As seen in the interface, use this for "test" notes when verifying system behavior before going live.
3. Formatting: Start every note with the date and your initials to ensure the team knows who to contact for follow-up questions.
