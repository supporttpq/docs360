# Passenger Information

### **Overview**

The **Passenger Information** section is used to define informational notes or errata that apply to bookings within specific stay periods.\
These messages typically provide additional details for customers or internal staff ‚Äî for example, **special conditions, restrictions, or exceptions** related to a booking.

### **Purpose**

* To communicate relevant information connected to bookings and stays (e.g., transport notes, exceptions, overlapping rules).
* To ensure both passengers and staff are informed about important travel details.
* To manage special conditions or exceptions within defined booking and stay periods.

The behavior and purpose of **Passenger Information for Real Transports** are similar to those used in **Charter Transports**.

### **Tabs**

At the top, you can switch between different **brands.**\
Each brand can have its own passenger information messages and settings.

| **Field**         | **Value**                         |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Stay From         | 08-10-2025                        |
| Stay To           | 29-12-2025                        |
| Booking Date From | 08-10-2025                        |
| Booking Date To   | 31-12-2025                        |
| Information       | This is a test for passenger info |
