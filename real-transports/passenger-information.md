# Passenger Information

### **Overview**

The **Passenger Information** section is used to define informational notes or errata that apply to bookings within specific stay periods.\
These messages typically provide additional details for customers or internal staff ‚Äî for example, **special conditions, restrictions, or exceptions** related to a booking.

### **Purpose**

* To communicate relevant information connected to bookings and stays (e.g., transport notes, exceptions, overlapping rules).
* To ensure both passengers and staff are informed about important travel details.
* To manage special conditions or exceptions within defined booking and stay periods.

The behavior and purpose of **Passenger Information for Real Transports** are similar to those used in **Charter Transports**.

### **Tabs**

At the top, you can switch between different **brands.**\
Each brand can have its own passenger information messages and settings.

### **Example**

For the transport **CPH‚ÄìCHQ‚ÄìRC7134**, a passenger message was created with the following details:

| **Field**         | **Value**           |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |
| Stay From         | 03-10-2025          |
| Stay To           | 31-10-2025          |
| Booking Date From | 03-10-2025          |
| Booking Date To   | 31-10-2025          |
| Information       | Test passenger info |
| Acknowledge       | Enabled ‚úî           |

This means all passengers traveling on this route between **3 October 2025 ‚Äì 31 October 2025**, whose bookings were created in the same period, will receive the message _‚ÄúTest passenger info.‚Äù_
