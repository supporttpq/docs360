# All bookings

This tab displays bookings and statistics according to a series of set filters. A requirement for the filters to work is to set them in pairs (Bkg start and end date / Dept date from and to / Arrival date from and to)

### **Bookings and statistics filters:**

* Brand
* Pax no — number of passengers
* Booking start date
* Booking end date
* Dept date from
* Dept date to
* Arrival date from
* Arrival date to
* Return from
* Return to
* All bookings
* Filter by bonus code
* User owners
* Transports
* Real Transports
* Hotels
* Status
* GDS Status
* Extra

### **Hide filters:**

A recently added feature in All Bookings is the “Hide filters” option. This allows the user to have a cleaner overview of the filters, giving him the possibility to hide the inactive ones. Although the filters can be hidden, there is also a checkbox called “Show hidden” on each of the filters. By checking it, you can see all the hidden ones or hide them by unchecking it.

An important thing to take into consideration is that even if the filters are hidden, by checking “Choose all”, the displayed results should include the hidden ones also.

To hide a filter from the selection list, you can go for example to a Transport and check the “Hide as filter on lists” option.

Also, a faster way to hide the inactive filters would be to go under **System Setup** and complete the “Hide filter” input. The values in this input represent the number of past days that must be used to determine if a filter must be set as hidden or not. For example: if you set 10, the system will hide the transports that have Fix Quotas older than the past ten days. The same goes for the user, hotel, and real transport.
