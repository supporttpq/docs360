# All bookings Totals

#### **Overview**

The **All Bookings Totals** section offers a summarized view of bookings based on various filters. It allows users to track the total number of bookings, passengers, and financial indicators like turnover and profit, across selected brands and periods.

This functionality is part of the **All Bookings** page and provides quick insight into booking volume and business performance.

***

#### **Purpose**

The All Bookings Totals section is used to:

* Summarize booking data across custom-defined filters.
* Quickly view totals for bookings, passengers, and optionally turnover/profit.
* Analyze booking behavior by period, transport, hotel, status, and more.

***

#### **Preconditions**

To use **All Bookings Totals**, make sure:

* You are logged in with appropriate access rights.
* You access the **All Bookings** page from the **Booking** menu.
* A **brand** is selected (either all brands or a specific one).
* You apply at least one **date filter pair** (e.g., Booking period, Departure period, or Arrival period).

***

#### **Instructions**

**🔹 Step 1: Access the Page**

* Go to **Booking → All Bookings**

**🔹 Step 2: Apply Filters**

Set the filters to define which bookings to include in the totals:

| Filter Type          | Description                                                                                   |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Brand**            | Choose to filter for **all brands** or just one specific brand.                               |
| **Booking Period**   | Set a **start and end date** to include bookings created within that interval.                |
| **Departure Period** | Set **departure from** and **to** dates to include only bookings departing within that range. |
| **Arrival Period**   | Set **arrival from** and **to** dates to narrow results by destination arrival timeframe.     |
| **Owner (User)**     | Filter by booking owner or creator.                                                           |
| **Transports**       | Filter by planned transport types.                                                            |
| **Real Transports**  | Filter by actual assigned transport services.                                                 |
| **Hotels**           | Filter bookings by the accommodation selected.                                                |
| **Status**           | Filter by booking status (e.g., Confirmed, Canceled, Pending).                                |

> ⚠️ **Tip:** Filters based on dates (Booking/Departure/Arrival) must be used as complete pairs (`from` and `to`) to be valid.

**🔹 Step 3: Display Results**

* After selecting all necessary filters, click the **Display** button.
* The system will generate a **totals overview**, showing:
  * Total number of **bookings**
  * Total **passenger count**
  * Additional financial data if enabled (like total turnover and total profit)

***

#### 💡 Notes

* The **totals** update only after filters are set and **Display** is clicked.
* You can combine filters to generate totals for a very specific segment (e.g., bookings for Resort A, departing in September, with Real Transport X).
* Use **Saved Views** if you frequently check the same total-based report.
