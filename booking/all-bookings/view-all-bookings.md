# View all bookings

### **Overview**

The **View All Bookings** page lets you **search, filter, and review bookings** across one or more brands. From here you can quickly see who is travelling when, check key details, and move on to statistics or totals if needed.

You access this page from **Booking → All Bookings**.

***

### **Purpose**

Use **View All Bookings** to:

* See a centralized list of all bookings that match your filters.
* Apply advanced filters on **dates, transports, hotels, users, brands**, and more.
* Prepare the data set that will be used in **Statistics** and **Totals** views.
* Save filter combinations as **views** so you can reuse them for recurring reporting.

***

### **Preconditions**

Before using **View All Bookings**, make sure that:

* You are logged in with an account that has permission to view bookings.
* At least one **Brand** is selected – otherwise no bookings or statistics will be shown.
* Date range filters (for example **Booking Start/End** or **Departure From/To**) are used **as pairs** with both **From** and **To** filled in.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you get no results, first check that a **Brand** is selected and that any date filters you use have **both** a start and an end date.
{% endhint %}

You can combine **one, several, or all** filters as needed.

#### 3. Display the results

* After setting your filters, click **Display**.
* The bookings list is updated to show only bookings that match your criteria.
* Click a **Booking No.** in the list to open that booking.

#### 4. Save a view (optional)

If you use the same filter combination regularly, you can save it as a view:

1. Set your filters and click **Display** so the list matches what you want to reuse.
2. Click **Save View** in the toolbar at the top of the page.
3. Enter a name (for example, `Today's arrivals` or `Last week – Brand DK`) and confirm.

Next time, select this saved view from the list to automatically re‑apply the same filters.

#### 5. Manage saved views (rename or delete)

To change or remove an existing saved view:

1. In the views bar, click the **three dots (⋯)** button to open **Manage Views**.
2. In the **Manage Views** dialog:
   * **Rename a view** by editing its name directly in the text field.
   * **Delete a view** by clicking the **trash can** icon on the row.
   * (Optional) Use **Multiple delete** if you want to remove several views at once.
3. Click **Save** to apply your changes.

***

### **Hide filters (optional)**

If you work with many filters, you can hide the ones you rarely use:

* Use **Hide filters** to collapse less-used filters and keep the panel clean.
* A hidden filter is still included when you choose **Select all** inside that filter.
* To show a hidden filter temporarily, use the **Show hidden** checkbox on that filter.
* Administrators can also hide filters automatically based on inactivity using **System Setup → Hide Filter**.

For a more detailed description of all filters and statistics tools, see [All bookings](./).

***

### **Best practices**

* Always confirm that a **Brand** is selected before clicking **Display** or **Statistics**.
* Use complete **date ranges** (both From and To) to avoid empty or misleading results.
* Start with **few filters** when troubleshooting (for example, looking for a missing booking), then narrow down.
* If the filter area feels cluttered, use **Hide filters** to focus only on what you need.
