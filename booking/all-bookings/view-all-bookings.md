# View all bookings

Go to the Booking menu and select All Bookings.&#x20;

This page displays bookings and statistics according to a series of set filters. A requirement for the filters to work is to set them in pairs (Bkg start and end date, Dept date from and to, Arrival date from and to)

Bookings and statistics filters:

* Brands: Select all brands or a particular brand.&#x20;
* Booking start & end date interval: bookings made in this interval will be displayed.&#x20;
* Departure date from & departure date to: bookings with the departure in this interval will be displayed&#x20;
* Arrival date from & to: bookings with the arrival in this interval will be displayed.&#x20;
* Return from & to: Bookings with the return in this interval will be displayed.&#x20;
* All bookings&#x20;
* Filter by bonus code: bookings with a certain bonus code will be displayed.&#x20;
* Additional filters are user owners by transports, by real transports, by hotels, by status, and by GDS status.&#x20;

For all these listed categories, filtering can be done for one, several, or even all available options. An important thing to take into consideration is that even if the filters are hidden, by checking “Select all,” the displayed results should include the hidden ones also.

You have also the possibility to save the view for a future view
