# View all bookings

#### **Overview**

The **View All Bookings** page allows users to display, filter, and analyze all booking records and associated statistics within the system. It is an essential tool for tracking operational data, managing departures and arrivals, and generating reports based on passenger or booking details.

This page is accessible from the **Booking menu → All Bookings**.

***

#### **Purpose**

The purpose of the **View All Bookings** page is to:

* Provide a centralized view of all bookings in the system.
* Allow advanced filtering by booking attributes such as dates, transports, hotels, users, and more.
* Generate statistics per passenger across different business metrics.
* Enable users to save specific filter combinations for future reporting and easy reuse.

***

#### **Preconditions**

Before using the **View All Bookings** page:

* You must be logged in with an active account that has access rights to view bookings.
* A **Brand** must be selected for the filters and statistics to function properly.
* Filters that work in date ranges (like Booking Start/End or Departure From/To) must be used **in pairs**.

***

#### **Instructions**

**🔹 Step 1: Access the Page**

* Go to the top navigation menu.
* Click on **Booking**.
* Select **All Bookings**.

**🔹 Step 2: Apply Filters**

Filters help narrow down the results. Here's what each filter does:

| **Filter Name**              | **Description**                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Brands**                   | Choose a specific brand or select all. This is required to display results.  |
| **Booking Start & End Date** | Shows bookings created in this period. Must be used together.                |
| **Departure Date From & To** | Filters bookings based on the departure interval. Used as a pair.            |
| **Arrival Date From & To**   | Filters based on the arrival date range. Used as a pair.                     |
| **Return From & To**         | Filters bookings by return dates. Used as a pair.                            |
| **All Bookings**             | Select to override filters and view all bookings.                            |
| **Filter by Bonus Code**     | Filters bookings with a specific bonus code applied.                         |
| **User Owners**              | Filters bookings by the users who created or own them.                       |
| **Transports**               | Filters by types of transport (bus, flight, etc.).                           |
| **Real Transports**          | Filters by specific real transport entries assigned to bookings.             |
| **Hotels**                   | Filters bookings by assigned hotels.                                         |
| **Status**                   | Filters by booking status such as Confirmed, Pending, or Canceled.           |
| **GDS Status**               | Filters based on the status of GDS (Global Distribution System) integration. |

You can filter by **one, several, or all** options in any category.

> ℹ️ **Important:** For the date filters to work properly, they must be applied as complete pairs (e.g., both “from” and “to” values filled in).

**🔹 Step 3: Use Hidden Filter Options (Optional)**

* Use the **Hide Filters** function to simplify the filter panel.
* Hidden filters will still be included if **“Select All”** is checked in a category.
* To show a hidden filter temporarily, use the **Show hidden** checkbox on that filter.
* You can also hide filters globally (based on inactivity) via the **System Setup → Hide Filter** field.

**🔹 Step 4: Save the View**

* After setting the desired filters, click **Save View** to reuse the same filter set later.
* This is useful for recurring reports or operational checks.

***

#### ✅ Best Practices

* Always double-check that a **Brand** is selected before displaying bookings or statistics.
* Use complete date ranges to avoid filter errors.
* When using filters across categories (e.g., Hotel + Transport + User), use **Display** to preview results before going to **Statistics**.
* If filters look cluttered, use the **Hide Filters** option to simplify the interface without affecting results.
