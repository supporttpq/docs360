# Statistics in All bookings

### **Overview**

The **Statistics** functionality in the [All bookings](./) page of Tourpaq lets you analyze booking and passenger data in different ways. You can see, for example, **profit per hotel**, **turnover per resort**, or **passengers per week**.

This guide explains **how to access Statistics**, which types of statistics exist, and **when to use each of them**.

All statistics in this view are calculated **per passenger**.

### **Purpose**

Use the **Statistics** view to:

* Get an overview of booking trends by **passenger**, **location**, and **time**.
* Analyze financial data such as **profit**, **turnover**, and **sales performance**.
* Compare booking activity between **two different periods**.
* Identify key performance indicators across **hotels**, **sellers**, and **destinations**.

For a totals‑only view (bookings, passengers, turnover, profit), see also [**All bookings Totals**](all-bookings-totals.md).

***

### **Preconditions**

Before using Statistics, make sure:

* You have access to the **All bookings** page under the **Booking** menu.
* At least one **Brand** is selected – no statistics can be generated without a brand.
* All relevant **filters** are applied in **All bookings** _before_ you open Statistics.
* You have clicked **Display** to refresh the data, and then clicked the **Statistics** button.
* Date filters that work in pairs (e.g. _Booking period_, _Departure period_, _Arrival period_) are used with **both** `from` and `to` dates.

All statistics are calculated **per passenger**, based on the current filter set in **All bookings**.

{% hint style="info" %}
If no statistics are shown, first check that a **Brand** is selected, that all date filters you use have both **from** and **to** dates, then click **Display** again before opening **Statistics**.

### **Types of Available Statistics**

The Statistics module offers several types of analytical views designed to help you evaluate booking patterns, turnover, and profitability.

#### Summary – when to use which statistics

| Statistics type       | Use it to answer…                                                                     |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Passengers**        | “How many passengers do we have per country, arrival week, resort, or hotel?”         |
| **Average Turnover**  | “What is the average revenue per passenger per country, arrival, or resort?”          |
| **Profit**            | “Where do we earn or lose the most (by country, arrival, resort, or hotel)?”          |
| **Average Profit**    | “What is the average profit per passenger in total or per country?”                   |
| **Percentage**        | “What share of the total volume does each destination, country, or period represent?” |
| **Possible vs. Sold** | “How much potential capacity is unused – in total or per country?”                    |

After choosing the **statistics type** and **level**, always click **Display** to update the results.

***

#### 1. **Passenger Statistics**

Shows how passengers are distributed across different dimensions. You can view passengers:

* **Total**
* **Per Country**
* **Per Arrival Date**
* **Per Resort**
* **Per Hotel**

This is useful for questions such as:

* Which **countries** send the most passengers in a given period?
* How many passengers arrive **per departure week**?
* Which **resorts or hotels** have the highest passenger volume this season?

***

#### 2. **Average Turnover Statistics**

Analyze the **average revenue per passenger**:

* **Total**
* **Per Country**
* **Per Arrival**
* **Per Resort**

Use this when you want to:

* Compare **average revenue per passenger** between countries or resorts.
* See how **arrival weeks** differ in terms of revenue per passenger.

***

#### 3. **Profit Statistics**

Shows **profit** earned from bookings (revenue minus costs), per passenger:

* **Total**
* **Per Country**
* **Per Arrival**
* **Per Resort**
* **Per Hotel**

Typical use cases:

* Identify **profitable or unprofitable hotels**.
* See which **resorts** or **countries** generate the highest profit.
* Evaluate profit **per arrival week** (e.g. high vs low season).

***

#### 4. **Average Profit**

Provides an overview of **average profit per passenger**:

* **Total**
* **Per Country**

Use this to:

* Compare how much profit you earn **per passenger** across different countries.
* Get a quick view of **overall average profit** in the selected period.

***

#### 5. **Total Percentage**

Shows how much each group represents as a **percentage of the total**.

Use this view to understand:

* What **share of total passengers** each destination or country represents.
* How bookings are **distributed in percentage** across your main markets.

***

#### 6. **Possible vs. Sold**

Compares **capacity** (possible) vs. **actual bookings** (sold):

* **Total**
* **Per Country**

This view is useful for:

* Seeing how much **unused capacity** you have overall or per country.
* Identifying where there is still **room to sell more seats or beds**.

***

### **Additional Tools**

The Statistics view includes additional tools for deeper analysis.

| Tool                                       | Description & typical use                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Totals / Cost and Profit**               | Shows total **cost** and **profit** for the filtered bookings. Use it to quickly check whether a specific period, campaign, resort, or hotel is **profitable overall**. |
| **Additional Sales per Seller / Turnover** | Ranks **sellers** by the amount of extra sales generated (e.g. upsells). Use it to evaluate **agent performance** and identify strong upsellers.                        |
| **Booking Date Statistics**                | Breaks down bookings by **creation date**, per **day** and per **week**. Use it to see **booking patterns** and which days/weeks customers tend to book.                |
| **Compare Statistics**                     | Lets you compare **two different periods** (Booking, Departure, or Arrival dates). Use it to compare, for example, **this year’s July vs last year’s July**.            |

#### How to use **Compare Statistics**

1. Set your **primary filters** in **All bookings** (e.g. Brand, date periods, destination).
2. Open the **Statistics** view and select the statistics type you want to analyze.
3. Enable **Compare Statistics** and define the **comparison period** (Booking, Departure, or Arrival date range).
4. Click **Display** to see both periods side by side and evaluate **growth, decline, or seasonal differences**.

***

### **Tips**

* After changing filters in **All bookings**, always click **Display** before reopening or refreshing Statistics.
* Combine filters for more granular views – for example, **profit per hotel** in a single resort for a selected time frame.
* Use **Compare Statistics** to analyze trends across different **seasons**, **campaigns**, or **brands**.
* For a compact, totals‑focused financial overview (bookings, passengers, turnover, profit), refer to [**All bookings Totals**](all-bookings-totals.md).

***

### **FAQ**

#### **1. Why are my statistics empty even though I know there are bookings?**

This usually happens because one of the key preconditions is not met:

* No **Brand** is selected.
* A date filter (Booking/Departure/Arrival) is missing either the **from** or **to** date.
* You may have intervals defined but at least one booking in the result has departure date not falling into a defined weekly interval;
* The booking departures in your search are over 12 months across.
* You changed filters but did not click **Display** before opening **Statistics**.

Check these points, click **Display** again in **All bookings**, and then reopen the **Statistics** view.

***

#### **2. Are statistics calculated per booking or per passenger?**

All statistics in this view are calculated **per passenger**.

This means that totals, averages, and profit figures reflect **passenger‑level data**, not just the number of bookings. Use the **All bookings Totals** view if you primarily need booking‑level totals.

***

#### **3. Which date filter should I use – Booking, Departure, or Arrival?**

It depends on what you want to analyze:

* Use **Booking period** when you care about **when customers booked** (e.g. campaign performance).
* Use **Departure period** to analyze **when customers travel out**.
* Use **Arrival period** to analyze **when customers arrive at destination**.

You can combine them, but always use date filters as **complete pairs** (`from` + `to`).

***

#### **4. Why do the numbers in Statistics differ from All bookings Totals?**

There are several possible reasons:

* **Different focus**: the **Statistics** view is **per passenger**, while **All bookings Totals** can focus more on **booking‑level** totals.
* **Different filters**: if filters (Brand, Status, Hotel, Transport, etc.) are not identical, the results will differ.
* **Different statistics type**: for example, **Average Turnover** and **Average Profit** are averages per passenger, not simple totals.

Make sure you use the **same filters** and understand whether you are looking at **per‑passenger statistics** or **overall totals**.

***

#### **5. How do I compare this year’s results with last year’s?**

Use **Compare Statistics**:

1. In **All bookings**, set your filters (Brand, date range, destination, etc.) for the **primary period** (e.g. July this year) and click **Display**.
2. Open the **Statistics** view and choose the statistics type you want (e.g. **Passengers** or **Profit**).
3. Enable **Compare Statistics** and set the **comparison period** (e.g. July last year, using Booking/Departure/Arrival dates).
4. Click **Display** to see the two periods side by side.

***

#### **6. Can I export statistics to Excel or another format?**

If export is enabled in your environment, you will typically see an **Export** or **Excel** option in or near the Statistics view. Use this to download the current statistics result set.

If you do not see any export option, contact your **Tourpaq administrator** or support team to verify whether exports are available for your user and configuration.

***

#### **7. How often are the statistics updated?**

Statistics are generated **in real time** based on the current bookings that match your filters. Whenever you:

* Create, change, or cancel bookings, or
* Adjust filters in **All bookings** and click **Display**,

the next time you open or refresh the **Statistics** view, the results will reflect the latest data.
