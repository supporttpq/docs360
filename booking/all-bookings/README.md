# All bookings

#### **Overview**

The **All Bookings** tab is a key reporting and monitoring tool within the system. It allows users to access a detailed view of all bookings and extract statistics using a wide array of filters. Filters are grouped by purpose: booking retrieval, transport/hotel configuration, and statistical analysis.

This section is designed for both operational oversight and performance analytics, supporting roles like sales agents, managers, and operations teams.

***

#### **Purpose**

The goal of this feature is to:

* Retrieve, view, and analyze all bookings based on defined criteria.
* Generate insightful statistics such as profit, turnover, booking trends, and customer distributions.
* Enable cleaner filtering and faster workflows with flexible filter visibility and system-wide optimization tools.

***

#### **Preconditions**

To use this section effectively, make sure:

* You are logged in with an account that has appropriate access rights.
* You select at least one **Brand** to begin using the filters.
* Filter pairs (e.g., booking date start & end) are **used together** to function correctly.
* Statistics will only be shown **per passenger** and require **a brand** to be selected.
