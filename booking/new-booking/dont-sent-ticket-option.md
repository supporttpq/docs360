# Don't sent ticket option

#### **Overview**

The **"Don't Send Ticket"** checkbox is a control feature on the **New Booking** page that allows users to temporarily suppress automatic **"Update booking"** emails when making changes to a booking.

***

#### **Purpose**

* To prevent customers from receiving multiple notification emails during internal or batch changes.
* To allow agents to **control when communication is sent** after modifications.
* Useful for correcting details, adding extras, or testing changes without notifying the customer each time.

***

#### **Preconditions**

* The booking must already be in **"OK" status** (confirmed).
* A change must be triggered on the booking, such as adding a product or modifying passenger details.
* The user must have **editing rights** on the booking.

| **Don't Send Ticket** | A checkbox that appears **after changes** to a booking already in OK status. If checked, **Update Booking** emails will not be sent upon saving. |

***

#### **Behavior & Logic**

1. The checkbox **only appears** when a change is made to a booking in **OK status** (e.g., adding a product).
2. When enabled (checked), it **suppresses the “Update booking” email** that would normally be sent upon saving the booking.
3. If the checkbox is **not checked**, the update email **will be sent** automatically upon saving.
4. After the booking is saved and the changes are applied:
   * The checkbox **resets (disables automatically)**.
   * The user must re-check it **again** for each future change if they want to suppress further update emails.
5. This checkbox **does not affect flight change emails**, which are **always sent as normal**.

***

#### **Instructions**

1. Go to a booking that is already in **OK status**.
2. Make a change (e.g., add a product, edit passenger info).
3. The **"Don't Send Ticket"** checkbox will now appear.
4. To prevent an update email from being sent:
   * Check the box **before saving**.
5. Click **Save** to apply the changes.
6. If you make additional changes later, **you must re-enable the checkbox** before saving again.

***

#### **Use Case Example**

* You add a meal supplement to a confirmed booking and do **not** want the customer to be notified yet.
* You check the **"Don't Send Ticket"** box before clicking **Save**.
* No email is sent to the customer.
* Later, you adjust the passenger's address without enabling the checkbox. This time, the update email **will be sent**.
