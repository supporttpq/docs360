# Don't sent ticket option

Don't send ticket option consists of a new checkbox on the new booking page that, if it is enabled, will not send update emails.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The checkbox will auto-disable when the booking is taken in "OK" status.&#x20;

For example, I have added a new product to a booking that was in "Ok" and clicked "Save passengers," and now a new checkbox has appeared. If it is enabled, it will not send an "Update booking" email when I save the booking.&#x20;

If I make another modification to the booking after that, and I do not mark the checkbox again, the update email will be sent like it normally does.&#x20;

Flight change emails will not be affected in any way.
