# Hotel Only Bookings

#### **Overview**

**Hotel Only Bookings** allow customers to book just a hotel stay without including scheduled transport services. This is facilitated by using a **car-type transport** as a placeholder in the booking system.

***

#### **How It Works**

* A **car-type transport** is created and linked to any existing hotel.
* This transport behaves like regular transport with:
  * Defined booking interval
  * Timetable
  * Fixed quota (allotment)
* Unlike flights or buses, **no airline company or tickets are involved**.
* Guests are free to choose their own **departure and arrival times**, as no transport service is actually scheduled.

***

#### **Purpose**

* To offer hotel-only reservations in the system without requiring flight or bus bookings.
* To maintain uniform booking and pricing processes by using the transport module as a flexible tool.
