# Copy Booking

### Overview

The **Copy Booking** feature lets you create a **new booking** and **copy passenger information** from an existing booking. This is useful when you:

* recreate a similar booking for the same travellers
* reschedule a trip and want to avoid retyping passenger names
* create a follow-up booking with the same passenger list

It saves time and reduces manual errors.

### Before you start

Make sure you have:

* the **booking number** you want to copy passengers from
* created a **new booking draft** with the correct number of passengers, transport and hotel selection ready

{% hint style="info" %}
After copying, always review the passenger details to ensure names, titles, birthdates, and contact details are still correct.
{% endhint %}

### Copy passengers into a new booking

### 1. Start a new booking

1. Go to **Booking → New Booking**.

At this point, you are ready to take allotment.
{% endstep %}

Before you click **Take Allotment**:

1. Locate the field where you can enter the **booking number to copy passengers from**.
2. Enter the **original booking number**.

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### 3. Take allotment and confirm

1. Click **Take Allotment**.
2. When prompted with the confirmation message (for example: “Are you sure you want to copy the passengers?”), click **OK**.

The passengers from the original booking are now copied into the new booking.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### 4. Save passengers and save the booking

1. Click **Save Passengers**.
2. Click **Save Booking** to complete the booking.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### What to check after copying

After passengers are copied, verify:

* passenger **names** and **titles** (spelling and ticket format)
* **birthdates/ages** (pricing rules can depend on these)
* room allocation (if relevant)
* who is marked as the **main customer/contact** (email/phone)

To edit passenger details, use [Edit Passenger](new-booking/edit-pas.md).

### Troubleshooting

#### I don’t see the “copy booking number” field

This field typically appears in the new booking flow **before** taking allotment. If you don’t see it:

* confirm you have selected **transport and hotel** first
* check if your user role/company configuration has this feature enabled

#### The system says the booking number is invalid

* Ensure you entered the correct booking number (no extra spaces).
* Confirm that the original booking exists and that you have permission to view it.

#### Passengers copied, but something looks wrong

Open **Edit Passenger** and correct the details before sending documents or taking payment.
