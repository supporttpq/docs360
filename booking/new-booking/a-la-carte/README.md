# A la Carte

### Feature

"A la carte" is a feature that allows users the possibility to configure their own vacation using products predefined by the operator. The "a la carte" feature provides seven different types of bookings:

* **Custom Hotel Days Booking,** which allows the user to search after check-in and check-out days in desired destinations. The system will calculate the price based on the rules in the system and provide offers to the user. The hotels available for this type of booking are special hotels with a special rule defined.
* **Multiple One-Way Flights Booking,** which allows users to select the route where they want to fly. This will be an extension of the "Booking for two one-ways" and will allow booking of multiple one-way flights, which can be GDS or one-way charter flights.
* **Hotel-only bookings are** already available in the system, and using this, the user is allowed to book only a hotel from a charter offer when having a specific price offer defined.
* **Transport-only bookings** is a feature already available in the system and allows users to book only the transport for a charter offer.
* **Circuit Bookings,** which allows the user to be able to book several flights and hotels in one booking if the arrival and departure dates are in synchronization with check-in and check-out dates.
* **A la carte packages** are available for end users that book online, and they will have available selections as suggestions or starting points. Users are able to change some components in their selections in order to better fit their wishes.
* **GDS One Way Flights Bookings** is a particular type of multiple flights described above and allows a combination of charter with GDS flights.
* **Multiple transports in one room** is a feature that allows users the possibility to take two transport charters and to book a single room.
