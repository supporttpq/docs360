# A la Carte

### Overview

**A la Carte** lets you build a trip from individual components that your organisation has preconfigured in Tourpaq (hotels, transports, price lists, and rules).\
It is typically used when the trip does **not** fit a standard “fixed package” flow—for example when you need **custom hotel dates**, **one-way flights**, or **mixed itineraries**.

A la Carte still uses the same core mechanisms as other bookings:

* **Availability** comes from allotments/quotas.
* **Prices** are calculated from configured price lists.
* **Discounts and supplements** are applied according to your rules.

If you cannot see A la Carte options in your Booking menu, your company/user may not have access to the feature, or the required setup (e.g., Custom Hotel Days hotels/rooms) is missing.
