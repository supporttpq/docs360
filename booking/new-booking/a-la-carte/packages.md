# Packages

Packages Generator can be accessed from Price List -> Packages Generator. Users can define packages that will be available for the web by accessing "Create" and selecting the "Name" of the package, the agency for which the package will be available, the start and end interval, the interval based on which the package will be generated, and the discount applied to the total price.

After clicking "Save," the package will be added to the list and can be generated.

Generated packages can be deleted by clicking Remove Packages, and after that, the rule based on which packages were generated can also be removed.

After a package is generated, it will be available in "Select offer":

Prices displayed in Select Offer are with discounts/supplements already included.

If a transport has discount prices defined, those will be considered in the displayed prices on the "Select offer" pop-up window. The user can select one package and choose to create a booking with it. After selection, the "Create booking" window will be displayed.
