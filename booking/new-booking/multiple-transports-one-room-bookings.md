# Multiple transports one room bookings

### Overview

In Tourpaq, in general, the transport and hotel are bundled into a single product, it is therefore not possible to take two different transports and book one room. With this feature you can select two different transports and merge the rooms of the same type and the same hotel.

{% hint style="info" %}
It is only available if the "Multiple Transports" feature is enabled. Contact Tourpaq support if needed.

### **Purpose**&#x20;

This page provides guidance on handling hotel bookings where **multiple guests share one room but arrive via different transports**.

A typical example includes **one booking for one room**, where **one guest arrives by car and another by plane**. Despite their different transport arrangements, all guests are registered under the same room reservation.

### Scenarios:

#### Example 1: Guest with different transports in same room

We'll choose two different transports with

* the same arrival
* on the same interval

and the **same** hotel with the **same** room type.

**Next, on the&#x20;**_**Allocate Passengers**_**&#x20;screen, the rooms will be merged by pressing the "Merge rooms by type" button.**

Merging rooms by type allows the system to **group passengers from different transports into the same room**, as long as they share the same room category (e.g., Double, Twin, Suite).

This is essential for scenarios where a **one room booking** includes guests **arriving via separate transports** (e.g., one by car, one by plane).

Now, the room is successfully merged, and two passengers from two different transports are able to stay in the same room.

Note: _Only one room is taken from the allotment of the hotel_

***

#### Example 2: Guest with same transport in different room

The first steps as in example 1.

Add another passenger who uses a transport with the same arrival as the 2 existing passengers, in the same interval, but the room type is different from the one in which the 2 passengers are already staying.

Next, on the Allocate Passengers screen, allocate the 3rd passenger and save.&#x20;

At this point, the room has been successfully merged, allowing two passengers from the same transport to have different room. However, it is essential that the user specify which transport the room should be assigned to.

***

#### Example 3 - Guest with different transports in different room

The first step is the same as it was in the previous example; the difference now comes in the second step, when we will add another 2 passengers who will use different transports with the same arrival, in the same period, same hotel, but in different rooms.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (200).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Next, on the Allocate Passengers screen, the booth room type will be merged by pressing the "Merge rooms by type" button.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (201).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

At this point, the room has been successfully merged, allowing two passengers from different transports to be in different rooms. However, it is essential that the user specify which transport the room should be assigned to.

When one or more rooms are merged, this will be indicated on the booking page using an info point.
