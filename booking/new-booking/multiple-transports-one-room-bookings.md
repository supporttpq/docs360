# Multiple transports one room bookings

### Overview

In Tourpaq, in general, the transport and hotel are bundled into a single product, and a single price is therefore not possible to take two transport charters and to book a single room. So this feature can do just that by selecting two charters and merging the rooms with the same type and the same hotel.

{% hint style="info" %}
It is only available if the "Multiple Transports" feature is enabled, and contact Tourpaq support if needed.

### **Purpose**&#x20;

This page provides guidance on handling hotel bookings where **multiple guests share a single room but arrive via different modes of transportation**.&#x20;

A typical example includes **a single booking for one room**, where **one guest arrives by car and another by plane**, possibly at different times. Despite their different transport arrangements, all guests are registered under the same room reservation.

### Scenarios:

<mark style="background-color:orange;">Example 1</mark>

We'll choose two different transports with

* the same arrival
* on the same interval

and the **same** hotel with the **same** room type.

**Next, on the&#x20;**_**Allocate Passengers**_**&#x20;screen, the rooms will be merged by pressing the "Merge rooms by type" button.**

Merging rooms by type allows the system to **group passengers from different transports into the same room**, as long as they share the same room category (e.g., Double, Twin, Suite). This is essential for scenarios where a **single room booking** includes guests **arriving via separate transports** (e.g., one by car, one by plane).

Now, the room is successfully merged, and two passengers from two different transports are able to stay in the same room.

Note: _Only one room is taken from the allotment of the hotel_

<mark style="background-color:orange;">Example 2</mark>

We will choose 2 different transports with the same arrival, in the same interval, the hotel with the same room type (which is merged), and then save the booking

**Next, on the&#x20;**_**Allocate Passengers**_**&#x20;screen, the rooms will be merged by pressing the "Merge rooms by type" button.**

Merging rooms by type allows the system to **group passengers from different transports into the same room**, as long as they share the same room category (e.g., Double, Twin, Suite). This is essential for scenarios where a **single room booking** includes guests **arriving via separate transports** (e.g., one by car, one by plane).

By using this feature, the room type becomes flexible enough to accommodate multiple arrivals under one room assignment, ensuring accurate check-in lists, reporting, and a smoother operational workflow.

Now, the room is successfully merged, and two passengers from two different transports are able to stay in the same room.

Add another passenger who uses a transport with the same arrival as the 2 existing passengers, in the same interval, but the room type is different from the one in which the 2 passengers are already staying.

Next, on the Allocate Passengers screen, allocate the 3rd passenger and save.&#x20;

At this point, the room has been successfully merged, allowing two passengers from different transports to share the same room. However, it is essential that the user specify which transport the room should be assigned to.

<mark style="background-color:orange;">Example 3</mark>

The first step is the same as it was in the previous example; the difference now comes in the second step, when we will add on the booking another 2 passengers who will use different transports with the same arrival, in the same period, same hotel, but different room.

Next, on the Allocate Passengers screen, the booth room type will be merged by pressing the "Merge rooms by type" button.
