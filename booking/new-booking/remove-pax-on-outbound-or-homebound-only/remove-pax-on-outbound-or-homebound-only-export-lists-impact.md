# Remove pax on outbound or homebound only, Export lists impact

### Overview

This document outlines the steps and expected behavior when exporting lists from the **Export â†’ List** section, specifically focusing on the **No-show** feature and its impact on various report types. The goal is to ensure that exported data correctly excludes passengers flagged as "No-show" based on their travel direction.

### ðŸ“Œ Notes

* The **No-show** status impacts passenger visibility depending on the travel direction (**outbound** vs **homebound**).
* Exported data dynamically adapts to exclude any passengers marked as "No-show" for the relevant segment.
* Ensure filters and report types are correctly selected to reflect accurate data exclusions.
