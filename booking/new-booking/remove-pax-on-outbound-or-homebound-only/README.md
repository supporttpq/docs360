# Remove pax on outbound or homebound only

### Overview

### What this does (and does not do)

**No-show does:**

In Tourpaq Office, you set this on the booking’s **Travel plan** per passenger and per flight line.

Example: the passenger travels outbound, but not homebound.

Use **No-show** when a passenger should be removed from **one direction only**.

* Mark a passenger as not travelling on a specific flight line.
* Let you mark outbound and homebound independently.

**No-show does not:**

* Remove the passenger from the booking entirely.
* Automatically carry over if you change the passenger’s transport.

{% hint style="info" %}
Terminology:

* **Pax** = passenger.
* **Outbound** = travelling out.
* **Homebound** = travelling back home.
{% endhint %}

***

### Before you start

* You can open and edit bookings in Tourpaq Office.
* You have permission to edit the booking’s **Travel plan**.

### Mark a passenger as No-show for outbound or homebound

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### 1. Open the booking

Open an existing booking (or create one).

Make sure the booking is in **edit** mode.

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### 2. Go to the Travel plan

In **Details**, open the **Travel plan** tab.

You will see a **No-show** column with a checkbox per travel line.

Each line is tied to a **passenger + flight segment**.

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### 3. Set No-show on the specific line

Tick **No-show** for the passenger on the outbound or homebound line you need.

The change is saved immediately.

You do not need to open the passenger screen first.

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### 4. Verify it stays set when you only edit other booking data

Edit the booking, but keep the passenger’s transport unchanged.

The No-show checkbox stays set.

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### 5. Know when No-show is reset

If you change the passenger’s transport data, No-show is cleared.

Common changes:

* Changing flight date or interval
* Switching transport/flight

This happens because the system treats the updated transport as **new travel data**.

{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Notes&#x20;

* No-show is set **per line**. One passenger can be No-show outbound only.
* No-show stays set until the transport line changes.
* If you change transport, re-check No-show afterwards if still needed.
