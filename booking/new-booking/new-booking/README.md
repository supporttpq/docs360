### **Package products**

When selecting a product that is flagged as a package for a passenger, all the products that are inside the package will be selected after saving the passenger, but with a price of 0, only the package will have the price set.

For a product to be set as package, you need to check the option inside **Edit Product Page** -> **Basic Setup** -> **Other Settings** -> **Package Type**
