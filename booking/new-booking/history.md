# History

Booking history is **where you can see all changes made to bookings by you or your team**. You can also see who created the booking and its initial settings.

The timeline of reservations typically includes detailed information about each booking, such as:

1. **Booking Details**: The name of the service (e.g., hotel, flight), location, dates, and other relevant information.
2. **Dates**: The date when the booking was made (e.g., check-in/check-out dates for hotels, flight dates, etc.).
3. **Confirmation Number**: A unique identifier for each booking that can be used for tracking or managing the reservation.
4. **Cost/Payment Information**: Total price paid for the booking, including taxes, fees, etc.
5. **Status**: Current status of the booking (e.g., completed, canceled, pending, refunded).
6. **Modification History**: Any changes made to the original booking, such as rescheduling, adding special requests, or upgrades.
7. **Cancellations**: If the booking was canceled, this would be part of the history, showing the reason and terms of the cancellation.
