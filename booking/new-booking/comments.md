### **FAQ**

#### **Which comments are visible to the customer?**

The following are customer-facing on the ticket:

* **Hotel Text** – shown on hotel lists and printed on the customer’s ticket.
* **To the customer** – printed on the customer’s ticket.
* **Ticket Attachments** – PDF files printed at the end of the ticket.

All other comment types (**Internal Text**, **Internal Attachments**, **Economy Text**, **Destination/Guides Text**) are not shown on the customer’s ticket.

***

#### **What is the difference between “Hotel Text” and “To the customer”?**

* **Hotel Text** appears **both** on internal hotel lists and on the customer’s ticket.
* **To the customer** appears **only** on the customer’s ticket and is typically used for short, customer-specific information.

Use **Hotel Text** when the same information is relevant to hotel/operations and the customer. Use **To the customer** when the message is only for the traveller.

***

#### **How can I make sure guides see specific information, but customers do not?**

Use **Destination/Guides Text** for information that should be visible on **guide and airport lists** only (for guides and transport staff). Combine this with **Internal Text** for additional internal notes that should not appear in any external list or on the ticket.

***

#### **Which comments affect finance-related overviews?**

Only **Economy Text** is used in the finance context described on this page. These notes appear in **Negative Balances** and **Unpaid Bookings** reports and are meant to help finance users understand the background behind outstanding amounts or special payment agreements.
