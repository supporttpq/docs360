# E-mails

### Overview

The **E‑mails** tab provides a log of all system‑generated e‑mails sent for a specific booking. This includes booking confirmations, tickets and travel documents, payment reminders and any other automatic communication related to the booking.

### Purpose

The E‑mails tab helps you:

* See which e‑mails have been sent for the booking.
* Confirm **when** a message was sent and to **which address**.
* Review the **exact content** that was delivered to the customer.

This is useful for support, troubleshooting and documenting what has been communicated.

***

### Preconditions

Before using this tab:

* The booking must be saved.
* At least one system‑generated e‑mail must have been triggered for the booking.
* E‑mail sending must be enabled and configured for the Brand.
* Your user role must allow you to **view booking communication logs**.

### Using the E‑mails tab

#### Access the E‑mails tab

1. Open the relevant **booking**.
2. Click the **E‑mails** tab in the booking details.

If e‑mails have been sent, they will appear in a list.

#### E‑mail log fields

Each row in the E‑mails tab represents one e‑mail sent for the booking.

| Field            | Description                                                                                              |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **E‑mail type**  | Describes the type of e‑mail (for example: _Booking confirmation_, _Ticket e‑mail_, _Payment reminder_). |
| **Sent date**    | The exact **date and time** the e‑mail was sent.                                                         |
| **Sent address** | The **e‑mail address** the message was sent to.                                                          |
| **View e‑mail**  | Opens the full e‑mail body, showing the content that was delivered to the customer.                      |

### Notes and limitations

* This tab is **read‑only** – you **cannot** resend or edit e‑mails from here.
* If no e‑mails are listed, it usually means that:
  * No e‑mails have been triggered yet for this booking, or
  * There is a configuration or delivery issue.
* For delivery problems (for example, the customer did not receive the e‑mail):
  * Check the **Sent address**.
  * Verify that the customer’s address is correct in **Customer information**.
  * Consult your e‑mail logs / E‑mail center or contact IT / system support.

### FAQ

#### 1. Can I resend an e‑mail from the E‑mails tab?

No. The E‑mails tab is **only for viewing** what has already been sent. To resend a confirmation or ticket you typically need to:

* Use the appropriate **send / resend** function on the booking (for example a "Send ticket" or "Send confirmation" button), or
* Use your central **E‑mail center**, depending on your setup.

Check your internal procedures for the correct way to resend booking e‑mails.

#### 2. An e‑mail is missing from the list – what does that mean?

If you expect an e‑mail but do not see it in the list:

* The action that should trigger the e‑mail may not have been performed (for example, booking not yet confirmed).
* The e‑mail type may be **disabled** in your Brand or template configuration.
* There may have been a technical issue before the e‑mail was created.

In such cases, verify the booking status and e‑mail settings, or contact your system administrator.

#### 3. The customer says they did not receive the e‑mail, but it appears as sent – what should I check?

If the e‑mail is listed as sent:

* Confirm that the **Sent address** is correct and spelled properly.
* Ask the customer to check their **spam / junk** folder.
* See if other e‑mails to the same address are delivered successfully.

If the address is correct and the issue continues, your IT or e‑mail provider may need to review delivery logs.

#### 4. Can I change the e‑mail address after an e‑mail has been sent?

Changing the customer’s address in the booking will affect **future** e‑mails only. E‑mails already sent will still show the original **Sent address** in the log and cannot be changed. If needed, update the address and then resend the relevant document.

#### 5. Who can see the e‑mail content shown under "View e‑mail"?

Only users with access to the booking and permission to view communication logs can see the content under **View e‑mail**. Customers do **not** see this log; they only see the messages delivered to their inbox.
