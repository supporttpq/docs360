# SSR

SSR codes are special codes sent to the airline companies in the reporting lists.

They generally describe a particularity of the product or if the guest has special needs. For example, if the guest has bought a meal on the plane and is vegan. Or if the guest has sports equipment as baggage.

In the booking, go to the SSR tab.

Click on edit and add the SSR code required for the guest.

In some case, the SSR codes are not displayed in the drop-down. This depends on whether or not the Reporting Type associated with the booking transport is allowed to have SSR Codes or not.

Click save.
