They generally describe a particularity of the product or if the guest has special needs. For example, if the guest has bought a meal on the plane and is vegan. Or if the guest has sports equipment as baggage.&#x20;

In the booking, go to the SSR tab.&#x20;

In some case, the SSR codes are not displayed in the drop-down. This depends on whether or not the Reporting Type associated with the booking transport is allowed to have SSR Codes or not.&#x20;
