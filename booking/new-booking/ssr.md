# SSR - Special Service Requests for Airlines

### **Overview**

**SSR (Special Service Request) codes** are standardized codes used in communication with airlines to indicate specific services or requirements requested by the passenger. These may include meal preferences, medical needs, or special baggage (e.g., sports equipment).

***

### **Purpose**

* Ensure airlines are informed of guest-specific needs in advance.
* Improve passenger experience by meeting requirements such as special meals or mobility assistance.
* Comply with airline reporting standards and procedures for special requests.

***

### **Preconditions**

* The booking must include a transport component (e.g., flight).
* The associated reporting type for the selected transport must support SSR codes. If not, the SSR field may not allow code selection.

***

### **Instructions**

1. **Navigate to the Booking:**
   * Go to the **Booking** module.
   * Open the desired booking where the SSR needs to be added.
2. **Open the SSR Tab:**
   * Click on the **SSR** tab inside the booking.
3. **Edit the SSR Codes:**
   * Click **Edit** to begin entering SSR codes.
   *   Select the appropriate SSR code from the **drop-down list**.

       > Example: _VGML_ (Vegan Meal), _SPML_ (Special Meal), _AVIH_ (Animal in Hold), _SPORT_ (Sports equipment).
   * If the drop-down is empty or missing expected values, the reporting type may not allow SSR codes for that transport.
4. **Save:**
   * Once the correct code is selected, click **Save** to apply changes.

#### **Important Notes**

* **SSR codes are sent to the airline** as part of reporting lists. Accuracy is critical.
* If multiple passengers require different SSR codes, you may need to assign them individually if the system supports passenger-specific SSR entries.
* SSR functionality may vary depending on transport provider and system configuration.
