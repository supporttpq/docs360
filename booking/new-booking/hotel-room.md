# Hotel Room

### **FAQ**

#### **Is it mandatory to assign a specific room number?**

This depends on your company’s procedures. The system allows you to assign a room when you need a **specific** room number. If your company does not require pre‑assignment, the hotel can typically allocate a room on arrival according to its own processes.&#x20;

***

#### **What should I do if no rooms are marked in green?**

If no rooms are marked as available:

* There may be **no free rooms** of the selected type for the chosen dates, or
* Allotments and room availability may not be set up correctly.

In this case, verify the hotel’s allotments and availability, or contact the person responsible for hotel setup or contracting.

***

#### **Can I change the room after I have already assigned one?**

Yes. Reopen the **Hotel Room** tab, select another **green‑marked** room, and click **Save** again. Then reprint the ticket so the updated room number appears on the customer’s documents.

***

#### **Where will the assigned room information be visible?**

The assigned room number is:

* Printed on the **ticket** for the customer.
* Available in the booking for internal users and may appear on relevant hotel/operations lists, depending on your setup.
