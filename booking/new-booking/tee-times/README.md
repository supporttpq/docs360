# Tee Times

### **Overview**

The **Tee Times** tab is used to assign a specific **date and time slot** to passengers for time-based extras (for example, golf tee times or other activities that run in fixed time slots). This makes it possible to reserve the correct time for each passenger and keep the booking aligned with availability.

***

### **Purpose**

* Select a specific **date and time slot** for a time-based extra.
* Assign reservation times to individual passengers.
* Ensure that time-slot availability is used correctly for operational planning.

***

### **Preconditions**

* The booking must be created and saved with at least one passenger.
* The booking must include an **extra** that supports tee-time/time-slot reservations.
* Time slots must be configured for the product in the system (otherwise no available times will be shown).

### **FAQ**

#### **Why can’t I see any available times?**

Common reasons:

* The selected extra does not have time slots configured.
* There is no availability for the selected date.
* The booking does not include an extra that supports tee-time/time-slot reservations.

If you expect times to appear, verify that the correct extra is added to the booking and that time-slot availability exists for the product.

***

#### **Do I need to click both “Take Allotment” and “Save”?**

Yes. Based on the workflow on this page:

* **Take Allotment** reserves the selected time slots.
* **Save** confirms the reservation changes on the booking.

If you close the page without saving, the reservation may not be stored.

***

#### **Can I change a passenger’s tee time after it has been assigned?**

Yes. Reopen the **Tee Times** tab, select the passenger, choose a different available time slot, and then click **Take Allotment** and **Save** again.

***

#### **Where will the selected tee times be visible?**

The assigned times are visible in the booking. Depending on your setup, they may also be included on printed documents and/or operational lists used by guides, suppliers, or activity staff.
