# Customer info / Details on customer card

### Overview

This feature enables authorised users to view and edit detailed customer information directly from the booking screen. When activated, the system shows a “Details” field on the customer card during booking which allows input of extra customer data (for example phone number, personal details) and stores it for future bookings.

***

### Purpose

* Provide quick access to customer details while creating a booking, without switching to the Customer Center.
* Allow editing and storing of additional details for a customer that will automatically appear on all subsequent bookings linked to that customer.
* Improve efficiency and accuracy of customer data for operational use (e.g., phone number, contact info).
