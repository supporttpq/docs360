# Individual payments

## Individual payments

### Overview

**Individual payments** lets you email **separate payment links** to passengers on the same booking, so each traveller can pay their own share in the **Customer Center**.

This is typically used when:

* A booking includes multiple travellers who want to pay separately.
* You want each passenger to receive the payment link directly (instead of sending everything to one main customer).

### Before you start

Make sure:

* The booking is created and contains the correct passenger list.
* You have the passengers’ email addresses.

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### 3. What the passenger receives

Each passenger with an email address will receive an email containing:

* Payment details for the booking
* A link to the **Customer Center**, where they can pay their **passenger total**
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Troubleshooting

#### A passenger didn’t receive the email

Check the following:

* Does the passenger have an email address filled in under **Edit Passenger → Customer Data**?
* Did you click **Save Changes** after entering the email address?
* Ask the passenger to check spam/junk folders (delivery can depend on their email provider).

#### An email was sent to the wrong address

1. Open **Edit Passenger → Customer Data**.
2. Correct the email address.
3. Save changes.
4. Send the individual payment email again (if your internal process allows resending).
