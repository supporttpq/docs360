# Circuit Bookings

Circuit bookings are custom made bookings. The feature is an upgrade for the hotel combination and offers more freedom to the user in selecting the component of the booking.

This allows the user to put together in the same booking more than 1 hotel and 1 transport. The hotels can be in different resorts or countries.

The be used, this requires One Way transports and Custom Hotel days enabled for hotels, along with the related pricelist. More information on these can be found in [Custom Hotel Days Bookings](https://docs.tourpaq.com/docs/a-la-carte/custom-hotel-days-bookings/) and [Multiple One Way Flights Bookings](https://docs.tourpaq.com/docs/documentation/multiple-one-way-flights-bookings/)
