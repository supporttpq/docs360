* Adjust internal cost data for rooms, transports, and other components as needed for financial reporting or recalculation.

***

#### **Preconditions**

* The booking must be created with at least one product, room, or transport service.
* User must have permission to access financial data and make adjustments (if applicable).
* Pricing and cost structures must be defined for the associated components.
