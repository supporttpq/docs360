# Golf Courses

### Overview

The **Golf Courses** page allows you to manage golf-related activities linked to a specific booking. It is used to assign passengers to golf rounds, define their handicaps and club numbers, and set up golf course reservations including prices and times.

This feature ensures that golf course participation and scheduling are accurately recorded and communicated between the travel agency, the customer, and the golf provider.

### Purpose

* To record which passengers are participating in golf activities.
* To manage player information such as **Handicap (HCP)** and **Club** number.
* To add and schedule golf course rounds with pricing and timing details.
* To centralize golf-related booking data for reporting and confirmation.

**Preconditions**

* A booking must be created and saved with at least one passenger.
* The booking must contain an **extra product** that uses a golf course reservation system.
* The product must have pre-configured availability (time slots) in the system.
