# Golf Courses

## Golf Courses Booking page

### Overview

The **Golf Courses** page allows you to manage golf-related activities linked to a specific booking. It is used to assign passengers to golf rounds, define their handicaps and club numbers, and set up golf course reservations, including prices and times.

* To add and schedule golf course rounds with pricing and timing details.
* To centralize golf-related booking data for reporting and confirmation.

**Preconditions**

* A booking must be created and saved with at least one passenger.
* The booking must contain an **extra product** that uses a golf course reservation system.
* The product must have pre-configured availability (time slots) in the system.

## **Golf Courses Extra Category**

The **Extras Category** page is used to configure and manage extra services offered to customers ‚Äî in this case, **Golf Courses**.

The **Type** defines the behaviour of the Extra. In this case, the **Type** must be set to **‚ÄúGolf‚Äù**.

Once the Type is defined as _Golf_, you can create one or more extra **categories** that use this type. The category determines how the Golf Extras are grouped and managed within the system. This configuration determines how the golf product behaves in the booking system and which rules apply to it.

Each extra category can be customized per brand and contains general, visual, and technical settings for booking, visibility, and integration.
