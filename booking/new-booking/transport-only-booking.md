# Transport only Booking

This feature can be set by using a fictive type room in a hotel.

It is used for one-way flights and also for charters.

A fictive room does not appear on the ticket, and you do not need a cost for normal use.

Profit Margin Rules requires a cost price even for fictive rooms; therefore, a cost price that is different from 0,- is required to make Profit Margin Rules work with fictive rooms.

One-way flights will require both options to be selected for a room, while flight-only bookings will need only the "Is Fictive" option.

Another setting that needs to be made is in Hotel, in the Web tab. It is the **Transport Hotel** checkbox.

A transport-only booking is like this in the office.

Information is taken from the hotel and is customizable.
