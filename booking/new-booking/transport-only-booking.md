# Transport only Booking

This feature can be set by using a fictive type room in a hotel.

It is used for One Way flights and also for charters.

A fictive room does not appear on the ticket, and do not need a cost for normal use.

Profit Margin Rules requires a cost prices even for fictive rooms, therefore a cost price that is different from 0,- is required to make Profit Margin Rules work with fictive rooms.

One way flights will require both options to be selected for a room while the Flight only bookings will need only the "Is Fictive" option.

Another setting that needs to be made is in Hotel, in the Web tab. It is the **Transport Hotel** checkbox.
