#### Add an emergency contact

1. In the **Passenger details** form, locate the **Emergency contact** section.
2. Click **Add**.
3. Enter the contact information:
   * **Name** – Full name of the emergency contact.
   * **Relation** – Relationship to the passenger (for example: parent, spouse, friend, colleague).
   * **Phone number** – Preferably with country code so the contact can be reached from abroad.
4. Click **Save** – the emergency contact is now linked to this passenger.

You can repeat this process for each passenger in the booking.

***

#### Confirmation

After you save:

* All updated fields become visible in the **Passenger details** overview for that booking.
* You can select another passenger from the list and repeat the same steps.

***

#### Best practices

* Always confirm the accuracy of **passport details** and **document expiry dates** well before departure.
* Make sure **insurance information** (company and policy number) matches the documents the passenger is travelling with.
* Use **Transport comments** for information that operational staff should be aware of (for example, special assistance or medical notes).
* Choose **emergency contacts** who are reachable during the travel period and who understand their role.

***

### FAQ

#### 1. Which fields are most important to fill in before departure?

At minimum you should verify and complete:

* **Passport number**, **document expiry date** and **nationality** for destinations or carriers that require them.
* **Insurance company** and **policy number** if the passenger has travel insurance.
* At least one **emergency contact** with a valid phone number.

Your organisation may have additional mandatory fields depending on destination or airline rules.

#### 2. Does information from Passenger details appear on tickets?

Some fields can be used in **exports and reports** (for example to airlines, insurers or destination staff). Whether they appear on tickets, or other documents depends on your local configuration and export setup. If you are unsure which fields are sent to suppliers, check with your system administrator or operations team.

#### 3. What is the difference between Passenger details and Customer information on the booking?

* **Customer information** refers to the main booking owner (payer) and is used for invoices and general communication.
* **Passenger details** store **per‑traveller** data (documents, insurance, comments and emergency contacts).

On bookings where the customer also travels, both sections may contain information about the same person, but they serve different purposes.

#### 4. Can I store medical or special‑needs information here?

Yes. Use the **Transport comments** (and any other comment fields configured in your setup) for short, relevant notes such as:

* Wheelchair assistance required.
* Severe allergy.
* Important medical device.

Do **not** include unnecessary sensitive information. Follow your organisation’s **GDPR / data protection** guidelines when writing comments.

#### 5. I updated a passenger but cannot see the change elsewhere – what should I check?

If changes are not visible where you expect them:

* Confirm you clicked **Save** in the Passenger details tab.
* Refresh the booking view or reopen the booking.
* Check if there are multiple passengers with similar names and that you edited the correct one.
* Remember that some exports (for example airline lists) may only refresh when the corresponding list or report is regenerated.

If the issue persists, contact your internal support or system administrator to review the configuration.
