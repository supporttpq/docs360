* Add another transport. Select the transport. This transport will need to be used as a one-way home since the guests will be going to Palma, but the transport has arrival point set as Crete.&#x20;
* Add hotel. Since the hotels are the same as the ones before, this line needs to be removed and click ignore filter by arrival. This feature will allow all hotels tied to both resorts to be shown. Select the hotel. Select the room. Select how many nights the guests will stay at this hotel and add transport.&#x20;
* Since there is no return transport from Crete to Billund a new search needs to be done. Change the number off nights to 4. There are several options for this transport. Let's choose the one going to Aarhus, and use one-way home.&#x20;
