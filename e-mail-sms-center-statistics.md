Dynamic E-Mail / SMS Statistic is a new feature released within the Tourpaq v6.2. Its purpose is to emphasize the overall functioning of the Dynamic E-Mail/SMS feature.

Within this feature you are able to monitorize the income and outcome data, such as: sent e-mail/SMS, failed e-mail/SMS, confirmed e-mail/SMS, queued SMS.

It also gives you the capability of analysing the total turnover made throughout the Dynamic E-Mail/SMS feature either for a given template/category nor an overall statistic.

For a more concrete monitorizing of the data, it also provides you a set of procentages, which show the opened, sent, failed or queued E-Mails or SMSes in raport to the total amount.

You can preview the data either for the last week, last month, last year or you can insert your own predefined date intervals. All the reports shown in the interface are made in relation to E-mail / SMS template that has been set up in the Dynamic E-Mail/SMS Center.

Another major function that it offers to the end-user is the ability to View a complete, more complex list of E-Mails or SMS, manually confirm them, see details about the bookings or even export the entire list into a file.
