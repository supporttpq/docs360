# Transport Payment Rules

### Overview

The **Transport Payment Rules** section is used to configure and manage the financial terms tied to transport bookings. Each rule defines an upfront **deposit** and an optional **second payment** amount. This is especially useful in systems managing prepayments or installment-based ticketing.
