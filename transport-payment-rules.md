# Transport Payment Rules

### **Overview**

The **Transport Payment Rules** page allows administrators to define and manage payment structures for transport services such as flights, buses, or other transfers.\
Each rule determines how and when payments are collected for a booking ‚Äî for example, through a deposit and a second (final) payment.

This configuration ensures flexibility across different brands, products, or transport types (e.g., charter vs. scheduled flights).

***

### **Purpose**

The purpose of this module is to:

* Set up transport-specific payment rules to control deposit and balance payment behavior.
* Define how much the customer needs to pay initially (deposit) and how much remains due at a later stage.
* Standardize payment policies across transport types or brands.

These rules are later linked to transport setups or booking configurations, ensuring that the correct payment schedule is automatically applied during booking.
