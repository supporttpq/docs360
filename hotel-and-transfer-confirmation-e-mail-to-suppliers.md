# Hotel and transfer confirmation emails to suppliers

### Overview

**Supplier confirmation emails** let you ask suppliers to confirm hotel rooms and transfer products.

This helps you validate bookings before you finalize them.

### Purpose

* Automate confirmation requests to suppliers.
* Reduce manual follow-ups.
* Keep room and transfer reservations accurate.

### How It Works

* Tourpaq uses the [**Dynamic E-mail/SMS Center**](email-setup/dynamic-e-mail-sms-center/) and a dedicated confirmation template.
* When a booking requires supplier confirmation, a **Send confirmation** button appears on the booking.
* Clicking it sends the confirmation email to the supplier.

### Notes

* You must configure a confirmation template in the [Dynamic E-mail/SMS Center](email-setup/dynamic-e-mail-sms-center/).
* Only bookings flagged as requiring confirmation show **Send confirmation**.

### Set up confirmation email templates

You can set up confirmation templates in the [Dynamic E-mail/SMS Center](email-setup/dynamic-e-mail-sms-center/).

Use one of the confirmation template types:

* Confirmation Transfer
* Confirmation Hotel

The template must be **Active**.

You must fill **Subject** and **Body**.

Also fill these sender fields:

* From name
* From email
* Reply to

The email includes a link for the supplier to **confirm** or **reject**.

The link is generated by the system and updates in real time.

Example: if you send a confirmation for 4 passengers (pax), then cancel one passenger, the supplier will see 3 passengers on the confirmation page.

### Hotel confirmation requirements

In addition to the email template, hotel confirmations require:

* A **Supplier** on the hotel.
* A **Reservation Dept Email** on the hotel.
* **Contract type** set to **Allotment** or **Request**.

{% hint style="danger" %}
If **Reservation Dept Email** is blank on the hotel, the email will not be sent.
{% endhint %}

### Transfer confirmation requirements

In addition to the email template, transfer confirmations require:

* An extra that acts as a transfer.
* A supplier on the extra.
* **Contract type** set to **Allotment** or **Request**.
* Category type set to **Transfer**.

This field is required.

### FAQ

#### Why don’t I see **Send confirmation** on the booking?

The booking must be flagged as requiring supplier confirmation.

You also need an **active** confirmation template.

#### Why wasn’t the confirmation email sent?

Check these first:

* The relevant confirmation template is **Active**.
* **From name**, **From email**, and **Reply to** are filled.
* The supplier has **Reservation Dept Email** filled.
* For hotels: the hotel has **Reservation Dept Email** filled.
* Contract type is **Allotment** or **Request**.

#### What does the supplier see if the booking changes after I send the email?

The confirmation link is updated in real time.

The supplier sees the current booking data when opening the link.

#### Can the supplier confirm both hotel and transfer from the same email?

No.

Hotel and transfer confirmations use separate template types.

#### Can I change the confirmation link in the email?

No.

The confirmation link is generated by Tourpaq and is not meant to be edited.
