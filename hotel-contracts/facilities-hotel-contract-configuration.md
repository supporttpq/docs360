### Purpose

Use the **Facilities** tab to define which facilities are linked to the hotel contract.

Facilities are typically used for on-screen display and supplier/customer-facing outputs.

### How it works

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Choose a facility template

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Review the facilities

Verify that key facilities are included (for example Wi‑Fi, pool, parking).

### Tips

* Keep templates consistent across similar hotels. It improves reporting.
* If a hotel’s facilities change mid-season, update the template first.
* Then reapply it on the contract if needed.

### FAQ

**Can I select multiple facility templates on one contract?**\
No. Only one template can be selected per contract.

**Where are facility templates defined?**\
They are configured at the company level. Your admin team maintains them.

**Do facilities affect pricing or availability?**\
Not directly. Pricing and availability come from Rooms/Periods and related rule tabs.

**When should I update the facilities on a contract?**\
Update them when the hotel’s amenities change, or when the wrong template was applied.

**Why don’t I see the facility I need in the list?**\
It is likely missing from your company templates. Add it there first.
