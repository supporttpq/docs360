# Actions - Hotel Contract Configurations

#### Purpose

The **Actions** tab allows administrators to perform **contract-level bulk actions** such as reimporting specific data sections, sharing contract content, or syncing selective data from external sources. It improves workflow efficiency by reducing the need to update each tab manually.

* **Partial Update:** After a new season is added, only room costs or allotments may be updated using this screen.

* Always verify results after reimport, especially in the **Rooms**, **Periods**, and **Costs** tabs.
