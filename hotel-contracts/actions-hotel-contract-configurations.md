# Actions - Hotel Contract Configurations

### Purpose

The **Actions** tab allows administrators to perform **contract-level bulk actions** such as reimporting specific data sections, sharing contract content, or syncing selective data from external sources. It improves workflow efficiency by reducing the need to update each tab manually.

### Related Workflows

* **Initial Import:** When a new hotel contract is added and the import from an external file (XML, XLSX, or API) is performed.
* **Data Correction:** When adjustments are made to the source system and you want to sync those updates into the hotel contract without full deletion/reimport.
* **Partial Update:** After a new season is added, only room costs or allotments may be updated using this screen.

***

#### Notes

* This functionality **does not delete** data that is not selected. It only updates/replaces selected sections.
* Always verify results after reimport, especially in the **Rooms**, **Periods**, and **Costs** tabs.
* A confirmation will appear if unsaved changes exist on the contract.

To be able to use this function is required to create an email template for Hotel Contract, otherwise an warning will be displayed.

## Save Hotel Contract without production details

During hotel contract negotiations, certain information may not yet be available (e.g., board codes, product names, or supplements). The system allows the staff to save a hotel contract without being forced to provide these details immediately. However, complete data must be validated at the time of import to ensure accuracy and consistency.

#### Purpose

The purpose of this requirement is to make contract creation more flexible by separating validations into two levels:

1. **Save-level validation** ‚Üí Allows saving contracts even when some fields are unknown.
2. **Import-level validation** ‚Üí Ensures all mandatory fields are present before the contract is imported and made operational.

This approach enables contract staff to store draft agreements without blocking their workflow while maintaining strict data quality at import.

#### Functional Requirements

1. **Validation Levels**
   * Save-level: Minimal validation, allowing optional fields to remain empty.
   * Import-level: Strict validation applied before importing the contract.
2. **Fields validated at Import only (on Board tab):**
   * **Extra Category** ‚Üí Mandatory only for import.
   * **Product** ‚Üí Mandatory only for import.
   * **Name** ‚Üí Mandatory only for import.
   * **Code** ‚Üí Mandatory only for import.
3. **PDF Export**
   * When generating the PDF, the system will use the _List Name_ from the Board Types for board references.
   * This ensures independence from individual naming conventions.
4. **Contract Staff Actions**
   * **Send Mail** and **Export to PDF** remain functional even if the optional data (saved but not imported) is missing.
