#### Purpose

The **Double as Single** tab is used to define additional costs (or discounts) when a double room is occupied by a single person. This is especially relevant for pricing logic and ensures fair cost allocation when occupancy is reduced.

#### How It Works

**Top Section â€“ Cost Percentage per Period**

You can configure percentage adjustments for each defined **contract period**.

|  **Per Pax**        | Set the cost per pax                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| %                   | Unchecked: The cost is added on top of the cost for the parent room;                                                                                  Checked: The cost is the percentage added on top of the cost for the parent room |
| **Trash icon (ðŸ—‘)** | Deletes the row.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
