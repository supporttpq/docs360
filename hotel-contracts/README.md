### Instructions

#### Accessing the page

Navigate to **Hotels → Contract List** in the main menu. Some setups label it as **Hotel → Hotel Contracts**.

#### Filtering contracts

Use the filters at the top of the list:

* **Contract Name**
* **Hotel Name**
* **Hotel Code**
* **Created Date**
* Toggle **Show Hidden** to include hidden contracts

Click **Display** to apply filters or **Clear** to reset.

#### Reading the table

Each row displays:

* **Contract Name** – Click to open the contract
* **Hotel Name** – As defined in the system
* **Hotel Code** – The internal code for identification
* **Created Date** – When the contract entry was created
* **Imported** – Whether the contract came from an import
* **Created User** – Who created the contract entry
* **Accepted / Rejected** – Review status, if used in your workflow
* **Rejected Comment** – Reason for rejection, if applicable
* 🗑️ **Delete** – Removes the contract entry from the list

{% hint style="warning" %}
Deleting a contract removes it from the list. If you need it again, you may need to recreate it or re-import it.
{% endhint %}

### FAQ

#### What does “Imported” mean?

It indicates the contract entry was created via an import flow. If it is not imported, it was created manually in Tourpaq.

#### What do “Accepted” and “Rejected” mean?

They reflect your internal review workflow. Use them to mark contracts as ready for use or needing changes.

#### Why can’t I find a contract I know exists?

Try these quick checks:

* Clear filters, then click **Display**
* Search by **Hotel Code** (usually the most precise)
* Enable **Show Hidden**
* Confirm you have permissions to view that hotel/contract

#### What is a “Hidden” contract?

Hidden contracts are excluded from the default list view. Turn on **Show Hidden** to include them in search results.

#### Who can create or delete contracts?

It depends on your user role permissions. If you do not see **Create** or **Delete**, ask an admin to grant access.
