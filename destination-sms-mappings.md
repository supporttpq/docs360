# Destination SMS Mappings

The SMS Destination function is essential for setting up email templates intended for use within a destination application, along with associated actions. Properly defined templates are crucial; without them, emails and SMS messages will not be sent. Note that some emails, such as those related to Excursions, Arrivals, Hotels, and Resorts, might have their text overwritten.

* Order - It is used when an extra order is purchased - an email/sms is sent with a message and extra order ticket
* Cancel Order - It is used when a service from Turpaq comes and cancels an extra order for various reasons. The template is used for extra orders paid but canceled by the service.
*  Payment Confirmation - It is used when an extra order is placed but the payment is not confirmed.
*  Excursion / Arrival / Hotel / Resort - are used to send Email/SMS from the destination application. If custom text is not selected, the text defined in it is sent.
