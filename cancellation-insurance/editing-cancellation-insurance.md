# Editing Cancellation Insurance

After booking a trip, the customer might want to cancel the booking. Cancellation insurance is the amount the customer pays for this case.

There are 4 ways to set the price for the cancellation insurance:

* Bulleted list item The first method would take into account the price that a passenger pays for the trip. It should be possible to insert 4 different ranges for the price. For instance: if the passenger’s price will fit in the first range, the cancellation insurance will have a value; if it fits in the second range, it will have another value, and so on.
* Bulleted list item The second method would take into account the duration of the trip. It should also be possible to insert 4 different ranges for the duration.
* Bulleted list item The third method would set the fee using a given percentage. In this case, the fee will be the percentage of the passenger’s price.
* Bulleted list item The fourth method would take into account the transport mode.

If cancellation insurance is paid, when cancelling the passengers, we can opt that the cancellation insurance will cover it. In this case, the cancellation fee will be equal to the price of the cancellation insurance.
