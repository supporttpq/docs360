# Extras Attributes

Attributes influence the behavior of the extra and allow guests to select a product that fits them.

Example: A Ski rental product can have an attribute specifying the height of the guest so that the suppliers or the agency can know what length the ski equipment will be needed for the guest.

Users can choose one or more attributes for an extra.&#x20;

An attribute will appear automatically on the Ticket and in Customer Center.&#x20;

To setup an attribute go to Extra setup menu Click on Extra attribute.

The next step is to complete the fields:&#x20;

* Name: name of the attribute.&#x20;
* List name: this is how you can find in lists.&#x20;
* Yes/No - When this type is mandatory the system understands 'no' as the checkbox is not checked, and 'yes' if it is. The system will not force the user to check the attribute&#x20;
* Decimal - usually used for financial amounts because it allows 2 decimal points&#x20;
* Integer - is a value with no decimal points. (Example: age - 18. Rejected value: 18,5)&#x20;
* Multiline Text - is a small description that allows text on multi lines, not only one as 'text' type&#x20;
* Text - small description&#x20;
* Time.&#x20;
* Click on save.
* Max chars: For decimal types you need to count the 2 decimal points, the comma and the integer values. Example: max 4 means '9,00' is accepted, '10,00' is not because it has 5 chars. Available only for Decimal, Integer, Multiline Text and Text.&#x20;
* Appears on voucher: the attribute will appear on vouchers.&#x20;
* Appears on hotel list: the attribute will appear on hotel lists.&#x20;
