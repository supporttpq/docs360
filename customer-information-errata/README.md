# Customer information (errata)

### Special Conditions and Guest Notifications

In certain cases, it is necessary to inform guests about specific conditions related to a destination, resort, transport service, hotel, room, or additional service (extra). These notifications may serve as general information or may require explicit acknowledgment from the guest.

### **Examples of Special Conditions**

* **Destinations**: Legal requirements such as visa regulations or local taxes.
* **Transport**: Operational details, e.g., a technical stop for refueling.
* **Hotels**: Notices of ongoing renovations or temporary service limitations.
* **Rooms**: Restrictions such as air conditioning not being available during certain periods.
* **Extras**: Practical details, e.g., an excursion with a meeting point at the harbor or a requirement to bring personal items like water.

### **Guest Acknowledgment**

When the information has a potential impact on the guest experience and acknowledgment is required, the notice will be displayed during the checkout process for the guest to review and confirm.

For bookings made via telephone, the relevant information will be presented to the sales staff, who are authorized to confirm the acknowledgment on behalf of the guest.

### **Conditional Relevance**

Some notifications may only apply to specific bookings. For example, if additional noise is expected at a hotel during a defined period and this was not yet documented at the time of booking, only guests who booked prior to the update will need to be informed.

### Specification

Customer notifications must respect the defined **start and end dates**, meaning the information should only be shown to bookings where the guest’s stay **overlaps** with this date range. A booking is considered eligible if any part of the guest’s stay falls within the specified start and end dates.

In addition, some notifications may only apply to bookings made within a specific **booking period**. In such cases, the information must only be displayed for bookings **created** within the defined booking start and end dates.

To summarize:

* **Stay Period Condition**: The notification is shown if the guest’s stay intersects with the defined validity period.
* **Booking Period Condition**: The notification is shown only if the booking was made within the specified booking period.

Both conditions may apply, and the information shall be displayed only when all relevant criteria are met.
