# Security measures

Starting with the 3.7 version, some new security measures have been implemented. Here is the list with those measures:

### Https connection[​](https://docs.tourpaq.com/docs/documentation/security-measures#https-connection) <a href="#https-connection" id="https-connection"></a>

The login page has now a more secure connection.

### MD5 encryption[​](https://docs.tourpaq.com/docs/documentation/security-measures#md5-encryption) <a href="#md5-encryption" id="md5-encryption"></a>

Now our passwords are saved in the database encrypted in the MD5 structure.

### Password strength[​](https://docs.tourpaq.com/docs/documentation/security-measures#password-strenght) <a href="#password-strenght" id="password-strenght"></a>

In the Edit User and Change Password (a new page that allows all the users to change the password) pages, in the password/new password region, we now display a message if the inserted password is too short, weak, good, or strong. The system will allow you to insert a strong, or at least a good, password.
