# Campaigns

Campaign is a feature in Tourpaq that allows the user to create a package of discounts and products according to a specific set of rules. Campaign feature can only be used with a campaign code.

A Campaign can be created in office, from **Extra Setup**/**Campaign**.

This page allows system administrators or marketing managers to **view, manage, and control discount campaigns** that can be applied to bookings. Campaigns are typically linked to special promotions, early booking incentives, or seasonal offers.

2. &#x20;When the campaign has a code and Force extras is unchecked, removing an extra from a passenger will not remove the campaign discounts (when removing the extra, the discount value will remain unchanged)&#x20;
3. When the campaign doesn't have a code, Force extras has to always be checked, else the campaign cannot be created.

### **Code**

  * % (percentage): the passenger will receive a discount based on a percentage of the Room price
  * Discount: the passenger will receive a fixed amount as a discount
  * Fixed price: the passenger will pay a fixed amount, regardless of the room price (Room price - fixed price = discount)

Note: A discount line cannot have more than 1 rule for each interval (if percentage has been decided for the first interval, fixed price and discount rules cannot be used anymore for that interval and line) All intervals must be filled.

### Discount Calculation

* **Per booking discount**

Only the first passenger receives the discount according to the requirements set

* **Per person Adult discount**

Adult passengers receive discounts according to the requirements set

* **Per person Child discount**

Child passengers receive discounts according to the requirements set

* **Per extra**

All passengers receive discounts according to the requirements set.

The extra percentage discount is calculated as a percentage from the total price of the extras available in the campaign for the passenger.

The extra discount gives the inserted amount as a discount regardless of the total price of the extras.

The fixed price discount gives discounts depending on the total price of the extra:

* If the inserted amount is greater than the total price of the extra, the discount will be the total price of the extra.
* If the inserted amount is lower than the total price of the extra, the discount will be the difference between the total price of the extra and the inserted amount.



* **Per room discount**

First passengers in the room receive discounts according to the requirements set. The rank refers to the room, and not the passenger.

A campaign setup should look like this (this is an example, as the campaign can be setup in many ways, depending on the needs):

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (21) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Discount Limit <a href="#discount-limit" id="discount-limit"></a>

There are 2 types of discount limits

* Per Booking - Discount amount given to all pax on the booking will not be greater then the set value
* Per Pax - Discount amount given to a pax will not be greater then the set value

They can be used separately or combined.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (22) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Campaign linked with product (Select your benefit) <a href="#campaign-linked-with-product-select-your-benefit" id="campaign-linked-with-product-select-your-benefit"></a>

This is a special type of campaign that gives a discount in relation with a selected product. The product must be in the list of products and needs a discount line.

More than one product can be selected.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (23) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The user will receive the discount after inserting the code and selecting the product the discount will apply to.

When selecting the product for which the discount will be applied, the product will also be selected automatically, both in office and webbooking.

The only exception is the seating product:

* In office you will need to first select the seating, save the booking and after that insert the code and select the benefit.
* In webbooking you will need to insert the code, select the product for the discount, then select the seating in transport layout pop-up.

**Special cases regarding combination of campaign features**

Combining some features of the campaign will result in various behaviours as explained below.
