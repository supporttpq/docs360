The **Deposit Rules** tab allows administrators to configure custom deposit and payment rule entries based on booking and departure date ranges. This enables flexible financial planning for specific travel periods.

| **Deposit Percentage**   | Deposit calculated as a percentage of the total booking value.                                                       |
| **Second Payment Value** | Value for the optional second payment (if not disabled).                                                             |
| **Disabled**             | Checkbox to disable this particular rule entry. When checked, the rule is ignored.                                   |

| **Delete (üóëÔ∏è icon)**    | Removes the rule entry from the list.                                                                                |

### **2. Actions**

* **Create Button**: Adds a new row to define a custom deposit rule.
* **Pagination**: Allows navigation through multiple rule entries.
* **Company Tabs**: Deposit rules can be configured globally (_Entire Company_) or for specific travel brands/agencies (e.g., Primo Tours, Bravo Tours, etc.).

### **3. Rule Application Logic**

* Rules are applied based on **booking and departure date range matches**.
* When multiple rules overlap, priority may be determined by specificity (more exact match of both ranges).
* Disabled rules are **not** considered in the payment schedule.

‚ö†Ô∏èNote: If a specific deposit rule is set per brand, it will override any rule set in the payment rule.
