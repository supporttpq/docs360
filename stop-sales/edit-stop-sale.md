The _Edit Stop Sale_ function provides tools to adjust, remove, or split existing stop sale records to better match business requirements.

#### **Purpose**

The purpose of the _Edit Stop Sale_ functionality is to:

* Modify the details of an existing stop sale period.
* Remove an active stop sale when it is no longer required.
* Split a stop sale period into multiple intervals for more granular control.\
  This feature ensures flexibility in managing sales restrictions and maintains accurate availability data for partners and customers.

**3. Split Stop Sale Records**

If you wish to split an existing stop sale period into smaller segments:

1. Enter the number of records to split the stop sale into, in the _‚ÄúRecords number to split stop sales in‚Äù_ field.
2. Adjust the **Start** and **End** dates for each segment if necessary.
3. Optionally, modify other parameters such as _Enabled_, _Removed_, or _Agreed Allotment_ for each split record.

This allows creating separate intervals while keeping control over availability and supplier agreements.

**4. Save or Cancel**

* Press **Save** to confirm and apply your changes.
* Press **Cancel** to discard modifications and return to the overview.
