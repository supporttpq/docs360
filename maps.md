# Maps

#### **Overview**

The **Maps** section allows users to configure interactive resort maps that are displayed in the **VisitSun mobile app** under the **Destination → Maps** tab.\
Through this feature, guests can view an interactive map of their current booking resort and explore **points of interest** such as hotels, attractions, meeting points, or local landmarks.

Maps are configured and managed from **Tourpaq Office → Guest App → Maps** by users with **Guide** or **Admin** access.

#### **Purpose**

The purpose of the **Maps** module is to:

* Provide guests with a visual overview of their resort location.
* Highlight important or recommended points of interest within and around the resort.
* Enhance guest experience through easy navigation and localized information.
* Allow guides and admins to manage map content directly from Tourpaq Office.
