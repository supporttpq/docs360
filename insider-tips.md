# Insider Tips

Insider tips are messages and recommendations that guests can view via the VisitSun app. They are configured in the system by logging in as a guide or admin and setting them up through the **Guest App -> Insider Tips** menu. Once set up, these insider tips are displayed in the app under the Insider Tips section for guests, offering advice or useful information related to their trip.
