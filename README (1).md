This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of the sales and customer activity. The data is segmented into various widgets, offering insights into bookings, destinations, revenue, top-performing entities, and operational alerts.

### üéØ Purpose

The dashboard aggregates and visualizes critical business data from multiple modules (Bookings, Offers, Questionnaires, Service Cases, and Finance). This allows users to:

* Track sales performance at a glance
* Monitor customer and destination trends
* React to service and support metrics
* Identify top-performing products and problem areas

### ‚úÖ Preconditions

* The user must have access to the dashboard page (depending on user role/permissions).
* Real-time or near-real-time data must be available in the database.
* System filters must be configured properly for user-specific views (e.g., agency or brand access).

### üõ†Ô∏è How to Use the Dashboard

#### üîç Filter Controls

These control the **scope of the data** shown in the dashboard widgets.

* **Booking Period**: Select a date range to view bookings created during that period.
* **Users**: Filter the data to reflect actions made by selected users.
* **Brands**: Choose one or more brands to limit the report to specific company identities.
