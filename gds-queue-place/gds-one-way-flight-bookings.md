# GDS One way flight bookings

Tourpaq Office allows defining GDS Transport which can be booked as One Way. GDS transport can be used as One Way if, when creating the transport, Dynamic Packaging is selected (Dynamic Itineraries should be selected first in order for Dynamic Packaging to be revealed).

Next step when defining this kind of transport is to define legs (departure and arrival) and to choose the provider: Please make sure that OneWay is selected.

Accessing "Configure" will allow user to select the filters for searching the GDS flights. After setting the filter, user should "Save Filters", otherwise the searching of GDS flights One Way will not be possible.

From this step, user is able to search for GDS OW flights in the booking page by using specific GDS tab. Interval definition and fix quota are generated automatically, after searching is done into the booking page.

User can create the GDS normal booking from this point. GDS One Way Flight can be combined on a booking with charter, hotel only, or normal one way flights, by simply added them on the booking.
