# GDS One way flight bookings

#### **Overview**

Tourpaq Office supports **GDS Transport** configured as **one-way flights**.\
This functionality allows agencies to combine GDS one-way flights with other travel components such as **Charter**, **Hotel-only**, or **normal one-way flights** within the same booking.

#### **Configuration**

1.  **Define GDS Transport**\
    To create a GDS one-way transport, start by defining a **GDS Transport** with **Dynamic Packaging** enabled.

    > _Note: “Dynamic Itineraries” must be selected first in order to reveal the “Dynamic Packaging” option._

2. **Set Transport Legs**\
   Define the **legs** of the transport, specifying the **departure** and **arrival** airports, and select the appropriate **GDS provider**.\
   Ensure that the **OneWay** option is checked.

3. **Configure Filters**

* Click **Configure** to open the GDS search configuration window.
* Set the filters to be used for **GDS flight searches** (e.g., departure time, airline, class, etc.).
*   Click **Save Filters** to confirm.

    > _Important: If filters are not saved, one-way GDS flight searches will not be possible._

#### **Searching for GDS One-Way Flights**

Once configuration is complete, GDS one-way flights can be searched directly from the **Booking page** using the **GDS tab**.

* When a search is performed, the system automatically generates the **interval definition** and **fixed quota** based on the search results.

* In the search window, the user can:
  * Select the **transport code** (only dynamic transports with dynamic packaging will appear).
  * Choose the **type of trip** (one-way-out, one-way-home, or both).
  * Specify the **departure** and **return dates**.

Based on the selected trip type, the system will return:

* **One-way-out flights**
* **One-way-home flights**
* **Both directions**, if applicable.

After selecting the flights, transport will be displayed on the booking at transport details.

#### **Creating a Booking**

After selecting the desired flights:

* The selected transport details are displayed in the **Transport Details** section of the booking.
* From this point, the user can proceed to **create a normal GDS booking**.

GDS One-Way Flights can be **combined** with other travel components on the same booking, such as:

* **Charter flights**
* **Hotel-only bookings**
* **Normal one-way flights**

This provides full flexibility for dynamic itinerary creation within a single booking.

#### **Expected Behavior**

* The system only displays GDS transports configured with **Dynamic Packaging** and **OneWay** enabled.
* Filters must be saved before performing searches.
* Interval and quota data are automatically generated when a flight search is performed.
* The booking behaves like any other GDS booking once the transport is selected.
