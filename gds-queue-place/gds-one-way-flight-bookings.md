# GDS One way flight bookings

Tourpaq Office allows defining GDS Transport, which can be booked as one way. GDS transport can be used as one-way if, when creating the transport, dynamic packaging is selected (dynamic itineraries should be selected first in order for dynamic packaging to be revealed).

The next step when defining this kind of transport is to define legs (departure and arrival) and to choose the provider. Please make sure that OneWay is selected.

Accessing "Configure" will allow the user to select the filters for searching the GDS flights. After setting the filter, the user should "Save Filters"; otherwise, searching for GDS flights one way will not be possible.

From this step, the user is able to search for GDS OW flights on the booking page by using a specific GDS tab. Interval definition and fixed quota are generated automatically after searching is done on the booking page.

In the following window, the user is able to select the transport code, which was defined (the list will display only dynamic transports with dynamic packaging defined), the type of trip, and the departing and returning dates.

Based on the type of the trip, the window will return results with one-way-out flights, one-way-home flights, or both.

After selecting the flights, transport will be displayed on the booking at transport details.

The user can create the GDS normal booking from this point. GDS One Way Flight can be combined on a booking with charter, hotel-only, or normal one-way flights by simply adding them to the booking.
