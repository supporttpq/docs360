# Submit a GDS Booking

The first phase of the booking process on GDS flights is the same as for charter transport.

One take allotment button: a check is made to see if the flight already configured to be used for this transport and departure is still available and the price has not changed. If the price is higher, the user is asked if he continues or not. In case the flight is not available anymore, a new flight is searched and displayed to be approved by the user. After a booking is made, it goes to “GDS pending” status. In this phase, the GDS tab of the booking window can be used to submit the booking to the GDS provider. Some payment rules might be applied to restrict the user from submitting the booking to the GDS provider if some payment has not been made (different rules apply). When the same checks are on take allotment are made and submitting results from GDS is displayed to the user.

If the flight used belongs to a low-cost carrier, the booking goes to status “TicketOK.” In this case the ticket is being generated by the airline.

For Galileo flights, a ticketing step is required. When submitting the booking, a ticketing limit is set according to settings made on the system, and if the flight is still available, the booking goes to “Hold and Confirmed” status (all segments are checked to be HK). If ticketing is not done within the ticketing limit, the booking is canceled automatically by Galileo. Booking submission to Galileo can be made without waiting for any payment from the user. That restriction is moved to sending a ticket request for a booking. When payment is made, the user has the possibility to use the GDS tab to submit the booking.
