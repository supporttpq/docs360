# Notification

### Overview

The **Notifications** page is a system-level tool used to **monitor, review, and manage issues and alerts related to bookings**. It centralizes all system-generated warnings, errors, and informational messages to help users maintain data integrity and ensure smooth booking operations.

Open the **Notifications** module from the main navigation to see a consolidated list of issues across bookings and products.

### Purpose

This module is intended to:

* Provide **real-time visibility** into booking-related issues
* **Highlight critical problems** such as unpaid or overbooked reservations
* **Assist users in troubleshooting and resolving errors**
* Help ensure **reservation completeness and accuracy**

By consolidating alerts by type and severity, this module supports **operational efficiency and customer satisfaction**.

***

### Preconditions

* Available only to users with permission to access booking administration and notifications.
* Booking data should be up to date and error-checking services must be running in the background.
* Some notifications (for example, **overbookings** or **Stop Sales**) rely on system configuration thresholds (such as allotment and agreed allotment).

***

### Page Structure

#### 🔹 Left Panel: Notifications Menu (Categories)

The **left-side menu** organizes notifications by type. Each category shows a **counter** for active issues.

| Category                | Description                                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Unpaid Bkg**          | Reservations with outstanding payments.                                                        |
| **Overbkg**             | Overbookings at various levels (Homebound, Hotels, Rooms, Outbound).                           |
| **Error Bkg**           | Errors that occurred while saving or updating a booking.                                       |
| **Warnings**            | General warnings that don’t block the booking but may need attention.                          |
| **Hotel Special Offer** | Issues related to hotel-based special offers (for example, rejected or inconsistent offers).   |
| **Extra Special Offer** | Issues related to special offers on extras.                                                    |
| **Upsale**              | Opportunities or issues related to additional product sales.                                   |
| **Stop Sales**          | Notifications related to active or upcoming Stop Sale rules and their agreed allotment status. |
| **Queue Management**    | Errors in background processing queues (for example, confirmations or communication jobs).     |

{% hint style="warning" %}
🔔 **TIP**

Use the counters next to each category to **prioritize** which notifications to address first (for example, start with **Error Bkg** and **Overbkg**, then move on to **Unpaid Bkg** and **Warnings**).
{% endhint %}

#### Central Panel: Notification Table

This is the **main working area**, displaying **detailed alerts**. Depending on the notification type, the central panel may present different data fields. Some of the most commonly displayed information includes:

| Column Name           | Description                                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Booking No**        | Unique identifier of the affected reservation.          |
| **Departure Date**    | The date of travel associated with the booking.         |
| **Customer**          | Full name of the lead passenger or customer.            |
| **Booking Total**     | Total value of the reservation (all included services). |
| **Paid Amount**       | Amount already paid by the customer.                    |
| **Balance**           | Remaining unpaid amount.                                |
| **Error Description** | Human-readable explanation of the issue or error.       |

Each row represents a **single notification event**, tied to a specific booking.

***

#### Filters, Sorting & Navigation

* **Pagination controls** are located at the bottom of the table to move between pages of results.
* A **records-per-page selector** lets you choose how many notifications to display at once (for example, 10, 25, 50).
* Clicking on **column headers** allows sorting by fields such as **Booking No**, **Departure Date**, or **Customer**.
* Depending on your configuration, additional **filters** (for example, by departure period or destination) may be available at the top of the list to narrow down results.

### Working With Notifications

Use the Notifications page as your **daily control center** for booking quality:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### 1. Select a category

1. In the left panel, click the notification category you want to review (for example, **Unpaid Bkg** or **Overbkg**).
2. The central table is refreshed to show only notifications of that type.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### 2. Review the list

1. Scan the **Error Description**, **Departure Date**, and **Balance** (if available) to understand the impact.
2. Use sorting (for example, sort by **Departure Date**) to focus on the most urgent cases first.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### 3. Open and fix the related booking

1. Use the **Booking No** (and, where applicable, the **Customer** name) to locate and open the corresponding booking in **All bookings** or another booking view.
2. Correct the underlying issue (for example, update payments, fix product selection, or adjust allotment/Stop Sales rules).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### 4. Refresh and verify

1. After saving the booking, return to the **Notifications** page.
2. Refresh the list or wait for the next automatic update.
3. Confirm that the notification has disappeared or changed status as expected.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

{% hint style="info" %}
For **Stop Sales** notifications, you can use the dedicated workflow described in [Notification on Dashboard Stop Sale](../stop-sales/notification-on-dashboard-stop-sale.md) to filter by **Only Agreed Allotment** and focus on the most business-critical rules.
{% endhint %}

***

### Special Notes & Behaviors

* Notifications **do not auto-resolve**—they must be handled and cleared through booking updates or internal processing.
* The system may **auto-refresh counters and lists** periodically depending on configuration (for example, every 30 minutes).
* The presence of **multiple notification types for a single booking** is possible (for example, a booking can appear under both **Unpaid Bkg** and **Warnings**).
* In some environments, **notification acknowledgment** features may be enabled to track who resolved which notification and when.
