# Price List Generator

### **Overview**

The **Generate Price List** page allows users to create, view, and manage scheduled or manually generated price lists for different destinations, transports, and hotels.\
This functionality is essential for maintaining accurate and consistent pricing across all travel products in the system.

Importantly, this feature **enables the automatic creation of large numbers of price lists**, ensuring that pricing updates are performed systematically across multiple destinations and date ranges â€” **significantly reducing manual work** and minimizing the risk of human error.

***

### **Purpose**

The purpose of this page is to:

* Automate the creation of price lists for different markets, destinations, and transports.
* Provide visibility over all existing and scheduled price generation rules.
* Ensure that all active transport and accommodation combinations have valid pricing for the defined periods.
* **Reduce repetitive manual tasks** by allowing bulk and scheduled price generation based on configurable rules.

By using this tool, users can efficiently maintain pricing structures across the entire product portfolio without needing to manually update each route or resort.

   * Use the filters (Departure from, Resort, Transports, etc.) to narrow the list of relevant entries.
   * Click **Display** to show results.
2. **Review existing price list rules:**
   * Check if a rule already exists for the required date range.
   * Look for outdated or overlapping periods.
3. **Edit a rule:**
   * Click on the Pencil on the left, on the line you want to edit
   * Click on Fix Quota to define Price List rules
   * Save the rule.
4. **Generate or regenerate price lists:**
