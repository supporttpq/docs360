The "Disabled" column will be marked with an "X" sign for that rule. The previous "Disable" button will now be "Enable" (to enable it back).

The existing allotment for the hotels in that resort for that transport will be changed: max allotment per flight will be 0. Also, the FHA on the pricelist will become 0. Therefore no more booking can be created from office or web, on that period for the offers on the transport and hotels on that resort.

In Stop Sale Resort Overview, click on the "Enable" button for one disabled rule.

The rule will be enabled.

The "Disabled" column will have a check sign for that rule. The previous "Enable" button will be now "Disable" (to be able to disable it back).

The existing allotment for the hotels in that resort for that transport will be changed: max allotment per flight will be back -1. Also, the FHA on pricelist will be back as it was the number of free rooms. Therefore, booking can now be created from the office or web, on that period, for the offers on the transport and hotels on that resort.
