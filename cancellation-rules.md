# Cancellation Rules

When a booking is canceled, a cancellation fee is set for each passenger. Cancellation rules are applied for calculating this fee. The fee is calculated taking into account the remaining days left to departure.

The system allows the defining of 4 different ranges for the number of days left to departure. When defining a range, the amount corresponding to the cancellation fee will also be set.

It is also possible to define a percentage instead of setting the amount (the percentage is taken from the total price of the passenger that is canceled).

Include the cancellation insurance in the total check box if used; adds the **Cancellation insurance** in the booking total

Cancellation rules that are applied to a booking are set on the transport when it is created.

Cancellation fee on a booking is calculated as follows:

If a cancellation insurance is paid, when cancelling the passengers we can opt that the cancellation insurance will cover or not cover the booking.

If the cancellation insurance is paid and Cover option is selected when cancelling the booking, the amount of the cancellation fee will be the cancellation insurance.

If the cancellation insurance is paid and Does not Cover option is selected when cancelling the booking, the cancellation fee will contain the price of the cancellation insurance and the amount set in cancellation rules.

If the cancellation insurance is not paid only Cover option is available when cancelling the booking, and the amount of the cancellation fee will be the one stated in the cancellation rule.

Infants do not get cancellation fee.
