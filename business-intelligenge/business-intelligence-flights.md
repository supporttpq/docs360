# Business Intelligence â€“ Flights

#### **Overview**

The _Business Intelligence â€“ Flights_ page provides an analytical overview of flight capacity and sales performance across different weeks within a defined travel period. It allows users to monitor sold seats, remaining capacity, and the progression of sales over time, helping to identify trends and optimize flight inventory management.

This module enables users to analyze flight data by **departure**, **arrival**, **transport type**, and **date range**, displaying the percentage of total capacity sold per week.

***

#### **Purpose**

The purpose of this page is to:

* Offer insights into flight seat utilization and sales dynamics.
* Track weekly sales performance versus total flight capacity.
* Identify underperforming or oversold flights.
* Support data-driven decisions for capacity adjustments, pricing, or marketing strategies.
