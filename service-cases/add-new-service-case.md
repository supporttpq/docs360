2. Click the **Create** button.

After entering the booking number, the system automatically populates booking information in **read-only mode**, including:

* **Customer Information** – Name, email, and phone number (email and phone can be edited by clicking **Edit**; changes are saved only for this service case, not the original booking).
* **Number of Passengers** – By age distribution.
* **Destination Information** – Flight, destination, and hotel.
* **Departure Date**
* **Room Details**
* **All other tabs from the booking page**

#### **Usage Notes**

* Always verify the **brand** and **booking number** to ensure the service case is linked correctly.
* Mandatory fields (e.g., **Reason for Complaint**) must be completed before saving.
* Attachments provide context and evidence for the service case; ensure they are added after saving the case.
* Service case **status** should be updated throughout the resolution process to provide an accurate overview in reports and dashboards.
