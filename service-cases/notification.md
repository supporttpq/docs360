### Overview

Service case notifications are designed to keep users informed about new activity on service cases, especially when a customer sends a new email. These alerts ensure timely responses and help users efficiently manage ongoing communication.

### Purpose

The notification system ensures that:

* Users are promptly informed when customer input is received.
* Service cases requiring attention are easy to identify.
* Office response times are improved through efficient task prioritization.

### Notification Icon

* A **dedicated notification icon** is located at the **top of the page**, next to the brand selection dropdown.
* This icon visually signals when new customer emails have been received on any service case.

### Notification Behavior

* **New Emails Marked**: When a customer replies to an existing service case, that case is **marked with a star** in the overview list.
* **Notification Counter**: These marked cases are **counted and shown** on the notification icon as a badge.

### User Interaction

* When the user clicks the notification icon:
  * They are redirected to the **Service Case Overview** page.
  * The view is automatically filtered with **"Awaiting Office Response"**, so only cases with new customer replies are shown.

### Refresh Interval

* Notifications are **refreshed every 30 minutes**.
* This means that users are notified at regular intervals, even if they are working elsewhere in the system.
