# Notification

Notifications for service cases have the role to let the user know when something new happens on a service case.

There is a dedicated icon for the service case notifications, in the upper part of the page, right next to the brand selection.

All service cases that receive a new email from the customer, are marked with a star in the overview, and those will be counted and displayed in the counter icon for notifications.

When pressing the notification icon, the overview page will be displayed having “Awaiting office response” filter set, so only the service cases with a new email from customer are shown in the results list.

The notifications are updated every 30 minutes, so if the user is working on something else, he will be notified every half an hour if there is something new on a service case.
