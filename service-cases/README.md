Access to this feature means managing complaints quickly and easily, following an intuitive process, using a user-friendly interface, and having all information in one place.&#x20;

Service case management provides all means to assure client’s satisfaction and gives access to statistics for a clear overview.

In the “Search service cases” section, you can use several filters to narrow your results list.&#x20;

All service cases are displayed, by default, for departures on the ongoing year, in a revers chronological order of the service case creation date.&#x20;

You can filter by:&#x20;

* User who created the service cases.&#x20;
* Awaiting office response checkbox – if marked, will automatically clear other filters and display only the service cases that received an email from the customer (marked with a star on service case number)&#x20;

After setting the desired filters, press “Display”.&#x20;

In the “Service case overview” section, the results list is displayed, with the following information:&#x20;
