The communication between agency and customer, regarding service cases, can be done via Email or SMS.

There are dedicated buttons for that, on the service case editing page.

For the SMS to work, “SMS integration” needs to be enabled for the company from “Feature access” by a super admin. After that, complete required information in “SMS configuration” tab in System setup.

Also, the “SMS service” needs to be activated by a super admin.

The SMS tool opens a simple chat dialog, from where the user can send a message to the customer on the phone number saved. Also, when the customer replies, that message will be displayed in the same chat.

For the email tool to work, it’s necessary to purchase a mail bee license key, accessing following link: [https://afterlogic.com/mailbee-net/email-components](https://afterlogic.com/mailbee-net/email-components)

“Mail Bee Platform” service must be activated by a super admin, for every brand.

After you have the key, complete the setup, going to Users menu/ Brands / Click on Edit and go to “Service case” tab and fill in all required information.
