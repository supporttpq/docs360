### FAQ

<summary>What’s the difference between <strong>Transport Type</strong> and <strong>Transport Mode</strong>?</summary>

* **Transport Type** describes how the transport is generated (charter/dynamic/system).
* **Transport Mode** is the physical category (boat/bus/car/flight/train).

</details>

<summary>Why do I see no results?</summary>

Common causes:

* The **Transport Date (Start – End)** range is too narrow.

* You are filtering on a **Transport Type** that is not used in that period.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What do <strong>GES</strong>, <strong>AOT</strong>, and <strong>BOT</strong> stand for?</summary>

* **GES**: guaranteed empty seats.
