# Communication

### Overview

The **Communication Service** is a Windows service designed to send information from Tourpaq to various vendors (e.g., airlines, hotels, transport companies). A common use case is transmitting **flight information**, such as periodic passenger name lists (PNL), directly to the airline company.

### Purpose

The purpose of this service is to automate vendor communication, ensuring timely and accurate transfer of passenger and booking data. This reduces manual work, increases reliability, and ensures vendors receive the necessary information to deliver their services.

### Preconditions

* Each **reporting type** requires its corresponding service to be enabled.
* To activate a reporting type, you must contact **Tourpaq Support** to ensure the service is enabled for your company.
