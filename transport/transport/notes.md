# Notes

### Overview

The **Notes** tab belongs to a specific transport configuration (example: _Billund → Tenerife_).

Use it to store internal context that does not belong in structured fields. Examples include pricing exceptions, operational quirks, and decisions made.

### When to use Notes

Use Notes for:

* agreements with airlines or suppliers
* exceptions for this route
* why a setting was changed
* known operational issues and workarounds

{% hint style="info" %}
Notes are internal. They are not shown to customers or external agents.
{% endhint %}

* This is a free-text field for your team.
* Write clear, actionable information.
* Start with date + initials.
* Avoid customer-specific information.
* Use **Save** after editing. The field may not auto-save.

### Recommended note format

Use a consistent format so others can scan and trust the history:

```
[YYYY-MM-DD - Initials]
