# Notes

### 1. Overview

The Transport -> Notes section is a sub-component of the route configuration interface (in this example, Billund - Tenerife). It functions as an internal registry where team members can add contextual information regarding a specific transport route that doesn't fit into standard fields like pricing, schedules, or inventory.

### 2. Purpose

The primary goal of this tab is internal communication and traceability.

* Centralizing Information: It prevents important details from being lost in emails or external chat threads.
* Historical Context: It provides colleagues who manage the route in the future with a history of decisions or specific route peculiarities.
* Operational Alerts: It serves as a space to record exceptions or special rules agreed upon with transport partners.

#### Field: Internal notes

This is a free-text area designated exclusively for the agency's internal use.

What to enter here:

* Specific Contractual Details: Note if there are special clauses with the airline for this specific route.
* Recurring Issues: If a route frequently experiences known delays or schedule changes, mention them here to alert the support team.
* Configuration Changes: If you have adjusted settings in some tabs, it is helpful to write a brief note explaining why (e.g., "Increased quota for Tourpaq DK due to high Easter demand").
* Ticketing Instructions: Specific deadlines or requirements for issuing tickets that the operations team needs to be aware of.

> Pro Tip: Information entered in Internal notes is NOT visible to end customers or external agents in the booking.

#### Best Practices

1. Sign Your Notes: While the system may track logs, it is helpful to add your initials and the date at the end of a note for quick reference.
2. Be Concise: Keep information clear and easy to scan for your colleagues.
3. Keep it Current: If a note is no longer relevant (e.g., a resolved technical issue), remove it or update it to avoid cluttering the workspace.
