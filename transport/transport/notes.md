# Notes

### Overview

The **Notes** tab belongs to a specific route configuration (example: _Billund → Tenerife_).

Use it to store internal context that does not belong in structured fields. Examples include pricing exceptions, operational quirks, and decisions made.

### When to use Notes

Use Notes for:

* agreements with airlines or suppliers
* exceptions for this route
* why a setting was changed
* known operational issues and workarounds

{% hint style="info" %}
Notes are internal. They are not shown to customers or external agents.
{% endhint %}

#### What to write

* **Contract details:** special clauses, deadlines, allotment rules, or cut-offs.
* **Recurring issues:** delays, schedule instability, baggage quirks, or common support cases.
* **Change log:** what changed and why.
  * Example: `2026-03-10 AB: Increased quota for Tourpaq DK due to Easter demand.`
* **Ticketing instructions:** requirements the operations team must follow.

#### What not to write

* Personal data that is not required for operations.
* Content that should live in a contract, SLA, or a ticketing system.
