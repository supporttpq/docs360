# Automatic Seating

#### Overview

The **Automatic Seating** feature is designed to automatically assign seats to passengers who do not already have seating. It ensures that unassigned passengers are placed into the airplane according to predefined rules, without requiring manual input from the user.

#### Purpose

This feature streamlines the seat assignment process, reduces manual work, and ensures passengers are seated before departure. It also provides flexible notification options to keep stakeholders informed once the process is completed.

#### Activation

Automatic Seating is enabled from **SuperAdmin** under the **Upsale** category. It is divided into two options:

* **Automatic Seating** – for normal transports.
* **Automatic Real Transport Seating** – for real transports.

#### Transport Page Configuration

When the feature is activated, a new section becomes available on the **Transport** page, containing the following settings:

* **Use Automatic Seating** – If checked, the system will automatically assign seats for this transport.
* **Hours before departure** – Defines how many hours before departure the automatic seating process will run.
* **Email address(es)** – One or multiple email addresses can be specified (separated by commas). After automatic seating is completed, a report is sent to the listed recipients according to the chosen reporting type.
