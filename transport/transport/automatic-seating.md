# Automatic Seating

Automatic seating is used to automatically place the passengers that don't already have seating, into the airplane.

This feature can be activated from SuperAdmin. It is included in the "Upsale" category and divided in:

* Automatic Seating - for normal transports
* Automatic Real Transport Seating - for real transports

When this feature is activated, a new section will appear on the transport page. It contains:

* Use Automatic Seating - If checked, automatic seating will be made on this transport
* Hours before departure - How many hours before departure the system will automatically place the passengers into the airplane.
* Email address(es) - Multiple email addresses can be inserted, splitted by comma. After the automatic seating will be made, an email with the chosen reporting type will be sent.
