# Passengers informations

### **Overview**

The **Passenger Information** section is used to define informational notes or errata that apply to bookings for specific stay periods. These messages typically provide additional details for customers or internal staff (**e.g., special conditions, restrictions, or exceptions**).

### **Purpose**

* To communicate relevant information related to bookings and stays (e.g., transport notes, exceptions, overlapping rules).
* To ensure passengers and staff are aware of important details connected to their travel.
* To manage conditions within specific booking and stay periods.

### **Tabs**

At the top, you can switch between different **brands.**\
Each brand can have its own passenger information messages and settings.

### **Example**

For the transport **BLLCHQ-M1**, a passenger message was created with the following details:

| **Field**         | **Value**               |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| Stay From         | 20-10-2025              |
| Stay To           | 31-10-2025              |
| Booking Date From | 01-10-2025              |
| Booking Date To   | 19-10-2025              |
| Information       | Transport Erata Default |
| Acknowledge       | Enabled ‚úî               |

This means all passengers traveling on this route between **20 October 2025 - 31 October 2025**, whose bookings were created in the same period, will receive the message _‚ÄúTransport Erata Default.‚Äù_
