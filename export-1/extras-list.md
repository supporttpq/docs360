# Extras List

### Overview

The **Extras Lists Export Module** is used to generate exports related to **extras** (e.g., ski rental, extra services) for operational partners such as suppliers. These exports help suppliers manage service delivery based on confirmed bookings and extras ordered by passengers.

Exports can be generated in **Excel XML** or **PDF** format, in both **English and German**, and include optional cost data.

***

### Availability

* **User Role**: **Administrator only**
* **Locations in Office**:
  1. **Export → Extras Lists** _(full access to filters and types)_
  2. **Users → Suppliers → \[A Supplier] → Communication tab**
  3. \*_Extras Setup → Extras → \[An Extra] → Communication tab_

Each of the above uses the same filter logic but may restrict the export to the specific supplier or extra selected.

***

### Purpose

This module allows administrators to:

* Generate structured lists of extras grouped by suppliers and bookings.
* Provide real-time or scheduled updates to suppliers.
* Output lists in various formats (PDF with/without costs, Excel).
* Support logistics for rental services (e.g., Ski equipment – Skiset).
