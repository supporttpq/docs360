# Export

### ‚úÖ Overview

Tourpaq Office supports exporting structured data for various business roles: hotel suppliers, guides, transport managers, and reporting personnel. Exports are generated in **Excel-compatible XML format** and are filtered based on **date intervals**, **transport**, **resorts**, **hotels**, and more.

### üéØ Purpose

The export module was designed to:

* Provide relevant, filtered data to external partners.
* Support integration with other systems via structured XML.
* Enable custom exports per business role (guides, suppliers, managers).
* Track changes to bookings over time for transparency and operations tracking.

***

### ‚öôÔ∏è Preconditions

Before generating an export:

* User must be authenticated with export permissions.
* Bookings, transports, hotels, and related data must be available in the system.

### üì¶ Notes & Special Behaviors

* **Repeatable blocks**: Many exports (hotel, rooming, guide) are structured in repeatable XML blocks per hotel.
* **Optional company fields**: Some exports include dynamic columns depending on company settings (e.g. VIP codes, party package names).
* **Passenger focus**: Passenger exports are ungrouped, flat listings with optional statistical footers.
* **Error state**: Bookings in `ERROR` status are conditionally included depending on context (e.g. revalidated as OK or canceled).

***

### üß† Tips for Developers

* Use XML templates with clear structure and schema validation.
* Booking history module must track every relevant field for change logs to be accurate.
* Pay attention to status transitions: `ERROR` ‚Üî `OK` define inclusion/exclusion in exports.
* Many exports share structure logic (inherit or reuse parsers where possible).
* Data anomalies usually stem from edge cases in booking status transitions or outdated rules.
