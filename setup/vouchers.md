# Vouchers

### Overview

Voucher documents are automatically generated by a **Windows service** that runs multiple times per day. The system ensures that vouchers for hotels, extras, transfers, and discounts are created according to predefined business rules.

### Purpose

The voucher generation process guarantees that all necessary travel documents are prepared in advance of customer departures. This automation reduces manual effort, ensures accuracy, and enforces payment and booking requirements.

### Types of Vouchers Generated

* **Hotel vouchers**
* **Extras category vouchers**
* **Transfer vouchers**
* **Discount / Supplement vouchers**

### Rules for Voucher Generation

   * Vouchers are generated **X days before departure**, where **X** is configured in **System Setup → Vouchers Generation**.
2. **Booking Conditions**
   * Status must be set to **OK**.
   * Booking must be **fully paid**.
   * A voucher of the same type (hotel, extra category, transfer, discount) must not already exist.
3. **Extras Categories**
   * If an extra requires attributes, all required values must be completed before the voucher can be generated.
4. **System Setup Constraints**
