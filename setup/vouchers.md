# Vouchers

#### Overview

Voucher documents are automatically generated by a **Windows service** that runs multiple times per day. The system ensures that vouchers for hotels, extras, transfers, and discounts are created according to predefined business rules.

#### Purpose

The voucher generation process guarantees that all necessary travel documents are prepared in advance of customer departures. This automation reduces manual effort, ensures accuracy, and enforces payment and booking requirements.
