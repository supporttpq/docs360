### **How It Works**

* The search bar is accessible from any page in Tourpaq.
* Users can search by:
  * **Booking number** – retrieves the specific booking.
  * **Customer name** – search by first or last name to locate bookings associated with a customer.
* The results displayed depend on the **agency filter** selected:
  * **Single Agency Selected:** Searches are limited to bookings for that agency only.
  * **All Brands Selected:** Searches across all bookings for the company.
* After entering the booking number or customer name:
  * Press **Enter** or click **Go**.
  * If a booking is found, the system redirects the user directly to the **booking page**.

***

### **Key Features / Functions**

* Search by **booking number** for instant access to booking details.
* Search by **first or last name** to locate customer bookings.
* Agency-level filtering ensures searches are scoped appropriately.
* Works across the system, accessible from any page for efficiency.

### **Examples / Scenarios**

* **Scenario 1:** An agent wants to quickly pull up booking #123456; they type the number and press Enter, immediately accessing the booking details.
* **Scenario 2:** A guide needs to check all bookings for a customer named “John Doe” in their assigned resort. Selecting their agency and searching the name will display the relevant bookings.
* **Scenario 3:** An administrator wants to see all bookings across the company for a customer; selecting “All Brands” allows them to view every booking linked to that customer.

### **Notes / Best Practices**

* Ensure the correct **agency or brand filter** is selected to avoid incomplete search results.
* Only bookings **accessible to the user’s role and agency** will appear in the results.
* For large companies with many bookings, using specific identifiers like booking numbers is faster than customer name searches.
