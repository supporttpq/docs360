# Global search

### Overview

Global search helps you find a **booking** or a **customer** from anywhere in Tourpaq.

It saves time because you don’t need to open several menus first.

### How to use it

You can use the search bar from any page.

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Choose what you want to search in

Check the selected **Brand/Agency** first:

* If you selected a single brand/agency, search is limited to that one.
* If you selected **All Brands**, search looks across the whole company.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Type what you know

You can search by:

* **Booking number** (fastest and most precise)
* **Customer name** (first name or last name)
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Run the search

Press **Enter** or click **Go**.

If Tourpaq finds a match, it opens the booking or customer right away.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### What it’s good for

* Jump straight to a booking when you have the booking number.
* Find bookings linked to a customer name.
* Avoid “wrong results” by using the correct brand/agency selection.

***

### Examples

* Find booking `123456`: type `123456` and press Enter.
* Find a customer called “John Doe”: type `John` or `Doe`.
* Search across the whole company: select **All Brands** first.

### Tips

* Start with a **booking number** when you have it.
* If you search by name, try only the last name first.
* If you can’t find something, check if you selected the right **Brand/Agency**.
* You will only see bookings you have permission to access.

### FAQ

<details>

<summary><strong>Why do I get too many results when I search by name?</strong></summary>

Some names are common.

Try a booking number instead, or use a more specific name search.

<details>

<summary><strong>What should I select: one brand or “All Brands”?</strong></summary>

Select one brand if you know where the booking belongs.

Use **All Brands** if you are not sure.
