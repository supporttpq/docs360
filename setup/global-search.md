This functionality allows you to search a booking by booking number, or a customer by first or last name, more quickly from any page.

If the user has selected in the agency dropdown one agency, you can find only the bookings for that agency. If "All brands" is selected, you can find all the bookings for that company.

After you insert the booking no. you can either press enter or click Go, and the system will redirect you to the booking page, if the booking is available.
