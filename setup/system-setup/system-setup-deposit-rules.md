# System Setup – Deposit Rules

#### **Overview**

The Deposit Rules section in the System Setup module allows administrators to define and manage payment rules associated with bookings. These rules determine the amount and schedule of deposits, second payments, and final payments for bookings in the system. Each rule is tied to a specific booking date and can be enabled or disabled based on business requirements.

This feature ensures that payments are tracked correctly, helping to maintain cash flow, reduce booking cancellations, and provide clear guidelines for customer payments.

***

#### **Purpose**

The purpose of Deposit Rules is to:

* Define the deposit amount (fixed value or percentage) required at the time of booking.
* Set the second payment value and due date if applicable.
* Control the timing of the final payment.
* Enable or disable rules based on current policies.
* Ensure consistent application of payment terms across bookings.

By using Deposit Rules, the finance team and booking agents can enforce payment schedules automatically, reducing errors and improving customer experience.

| **Deposit Percentage**   | The percentage of the total booking cost required as a deposit. Used when deposits are calculated as a percentage instead of a fixed value.                                      |
| **Second Payment Value** | The amount required as the second payment, if applicable.                                                                                                                        |

| **Last Payment Due**     | The number of days before the departure date that the last payment must be completed.                                                                                            |
| **Delete (Trash Icon)**  | Allows administrators to delete a specific deposit rule. Use this with caution, as deleted rules cannot be recovered.                                                            |
