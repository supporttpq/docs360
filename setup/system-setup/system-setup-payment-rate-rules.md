# System Setup â€“ Payment Rate Rules

### **Overview**

The **Payment Rate Rules** define how payments for bookings are structured in Tourpaq. Administrators can configure whether a booking requires a single payment or multiple installments, ensuring flexibility in how customers manage their payments.

### **Purpose**

The purpose of payment rate rules is to:

* Allow companies to customize payment plans based on their business model.
* Provide customers with flexible options such as deposit-based payments.
* Ensure that booking payment structures are consistent across all agencies.

### **Configuration Options**

| **Rule Type**           | **Description**                                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Single Rate Payment** | The full booking amount must be paid in a single transaction.                                               |
| **Two Rate Payments**   | Splits the booking payment into two installments: a deposit and the remaining balance.                      |
| **Three Rate Payments** | Splits the booking payment into three installments: a deposit, a second payment, and the remaining balance. |

### **How It Works**

* The **deposit** is collected at the time of booking (or within the specified deadline).
* The **second payment** is due before departure, according to company policy.
* The **balance** must be paid before the booking is confirmed as fully paid.

Administrators can define the percentage or amount required for each installment, ensuring payment flexibility while securing company revenue.
