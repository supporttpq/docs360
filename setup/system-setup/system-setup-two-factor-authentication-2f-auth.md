# System Setup – Two-Factor Authentication (2F Auth)

### Overview

The **2F Auth (Two-Factor Authentication)** section of the **System Setup** allows administrators to configure and enforce additional security layers for user logins. By enabling these options, users are required to verify their identity with a second authentication factor besides their regular password, making the system more secure against unauthorized access.

Go to **Setup → System Setup → Two-Factor Authentication (2F Auth)**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Enabling 2FA can lock users out if their phone/email is not correct.

Validate contact data and test with a pilot user first.
{% endhint %}

### Purpose

This section protects user accounts with enhanced login security.

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) reduces account takeover risk because an attacker needs both the password and a second factor (SMS, email, or an authenticator app).

### Fields & Options

#### 1. **Authenticate with SMS**

* **Description:** Users will receive a verification code via SMS each time they log in.
* **Use case:** Recommended if mobile phone numbers are already stored and SMS service is configured.
* **Requirement:** A working SMS gateway and valid phone number associated with each user.

#### 2. **Authenticate with Email**

* **Description:** Users will receive a one-time verification code via email for login confirmation.
* **Use case:** Ideal when email access is reliable and mobile devices are not always available.
* **Requirement:** User must have a valid email address configured in the system.

#### 3. **Authenticate with an Authenticator App**

* **Description:** Users authenticate by entering a code generated by an authenticator application (e.g., Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator).
* **Use case:** Provides a more secure and offline-capable method of authentication.
* **Requirement:** Users must first link their account with an authenticator app.
