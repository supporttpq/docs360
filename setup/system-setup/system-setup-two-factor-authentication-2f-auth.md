# System Setup – Two-Factor Authentication (2F Auth)

### Overview

The **2F Auth (Two-Factor Authentication)** section of the **System Setup** allows administrators to configure and enforce additional security layers for user logins. By enabling these options, users are required to verify their identity with a second authentication factor besides their regular password, making the system more secure against unauthorized access.

### Purpose

The purpose of this section is to ensure that user accounts are protected with enhanced login security. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) reduces the risk of compromised accounts, as attackers would need access not only to the user’s password but also to their secondary authentication method (SMS, email, or authenticator app).

### Fields & Options

#### 1. **Authenticate with SMS**

* **Description:** Users will receive a verification code via SMS each time they log in.
* **Use case:** Recommended if mobile phone numbers are already stored and SMS service is configured.
* **Requirement:** A working SMS gateway and valid phone number associated with each user.

#### 2. **Authenticate with Email**

* **Description:** Users will receive a one-time verification code via email for login confirmation.
* **Use case:** Ideal when email access is reliable and mobile devices are not always available.
* **Requirement:** User must have a valid email address configured in the system.

#### 3. **Authenticate with an Authenticator App**

* **Description:** Users authenticate by entering a code generated by an authenticator application (e.g., Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator).
* **Use case:** Provides a more secure and offline-capable method of authentication.
* **Requirement:** Users must first link their account with an authenticator app.

### Instructions for Configuration

1. **Navigate to the System Setup panel**
   * Access the **System Setup** section from the top menu.
   * Select the **2F Auth** tab.
2. **Select Authentication Options**
   * Tick the checkbox for the desired authentication method(s):
     * **Authenticate with SMS**
     * **Authenticate with Email**
     * **Authenticate with an authenticator app**
3. **Save and Apply**
   * Once enabled, all users will be required to use the chosen authentication method(s) at their next login.
4. **Communicate with Users**
   * Inform users about the activation of 2FA.
   * Provide them with setup instructions (e.g., how to download an authenticator app or ensure they have access to their registered email/phone).

✅ **Note:** Once these options are activated, users will **always** be required to use 2FA at login. It is recommended to choose at least one method that is most suitable for your organization’s workflow.
