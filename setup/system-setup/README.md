# System Setup

### **Overview**

The **System Setup** module defines the global configuration of the Tourpaq platform. These settings affect the entire company, including how bookings, payments, integrations, and reports are managed.\
Only users with **Administrator** rights can access and modify these values. Rules and configurations created here cannot be deleted manually; removal is handled programmatically to ensure data integrity.

### **Purpose**

The purpose of the System Setup is to:

* Establish **company-wide defaults** such as currency, payment rules, and booking visibility.
* Control **functional behavior** of dashboards, reminders, filters, and allotments.
* Configure **communication services**, including SMS and email.
* Manage **integration credentials** for third-party providers (transport, hotels, GDS, car rental, etc.).
* Define **reporting and export parameters** to support financial and operational workflows.

Correct setup ensures that the Tourpaq system functions consistently across all brands and agencies, minimizing errors in pricing, payments, and booking operations.
