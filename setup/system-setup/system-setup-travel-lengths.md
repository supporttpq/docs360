# System Setup – Travel Lengths

### **Overview**

The **Travel Lengths** section defines the duration intervals for trips in Tourpaq. These intervals are used in the **Select Offer** page and help categorize trips based on their length in days.

### **Purpose**

* Allow users to filter offers based on trip duration.
* Standardize trip intervals across all brands and agencies.
* Enable flexible configuration of custom trip lengths for charter or package tours.

### **Configuration Steps**

1. **Default Setting**
   * If no custom intervals are set, trips default to a 7-day duration.
2. **Add Custom Interval**
   * Navigate to **System Setup → Travel Length tab**.
   * Click **Add**.
   * Enter the **Days From** and **Days To** values for the new interval.
   * Click **Save**.
3. **Apply Interval in Select Offer Page**
   * Reload the **Select Offer** page to display the newly added interval.
   * Multiple intervals can be added to cover different trip durations.

### **Usage Notes**

* Intervals must be non-overlapping and correctly span the intended days.
* Administrators can add or modify intervals at any time.
* Changes are immediately reflected in the offer selection interface after page reload.
