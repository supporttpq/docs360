# Internal logs

### **Overview / Purpose**

Internal Logs is a management tool designed for **administrative oversight** in Tourpaq. It allows administrators to track and review all actions performed by users in the system. This provides **accountability**, helps **troubleshoot issues**, and ensures compliance with internal processes.

### **How It Works**

* The Internal Logs tool is accessible via:\
  **Setup â†’ Internal Logs**
* Once opened, you can specify a **date range** using the start and end dates to narrow down the actions you want to review.
* Administrators can **filter actions** to quickly find relevant entries.

***

### **Key Features / Functions**

* **Date Range Selection:** Choose the period for which you want to view logs.
* **Agency Filter:** Limit the logs to actions performed by users in specific agencies.
* **Action Type Filter:** Filter by types of system actions, including but not limited to:
  * Financial exports
  * Hotel list exports
  * Hotel communications
  * Customer merges
  * Changes in discounts or products
  * Modifications to room types or hotel extra bed discounts
* **User Filter:** View actions performed by specific users or all users.
* **Comprehensive Activity Tracking:** The system logs most user activities, giving a complete picture of operational changes.

### **Notes / Best Practices**

* Only **administrators** have access to Internal Logs.
* Use filters to **narrow down results**; without filters, the system displays **all actions** performed by all users.
* Regularly reviewing Internal Logs helps **identify errors or misuse**, maintain **data integrity**, and supports **internal audits**.
* Exporting logs periodically can provide a historical record of system activity.
