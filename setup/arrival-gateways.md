### Features

* **Delete Functionality:** Each entry has a delete icon (trash bin) to remove it from the list.

### Column Breakdown

1. **IATA Code:** The official three-letter airport code (e.g., PMI for Palma - Mallorca).
2. **Plaintext:** The full airport name or common destination name.
3. **Plaintext (Not Flight):** A simplified version of the destination name.
4. **Area Insurance:** Categorization of the location under specific insurance areas (e.g., Europe, Extended Europe, World).
5. **Actions:** A delete icon to remove entries from the system.

### Notes

1. "Extended Europe" indicates destinations that are not part of the standard European classification but are still considered within an extended coverage area.

"**Extended Europe**" in the context of **insurance**, particularly **travel or car insurance**, refers to a broader geographic coverage area than just the countries of the **European Union (EU)** or the **European Economic Area (EEA)**.

#### What is "Extended Europe"?

It typically includes:

* All **EU and EEA countries**
* **Non-EU European countries** like:
  * **Switzerland**
  * **Norway**, **Iceland**, and **Liechtenstein** (members of EEA, but not EU)
  * Often **UK** (post-Brexit, sometimes treated separately)
  * **Western Balkan countries** (e.g., Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina)
  * **Turkey** and **some parts of Eastern Europe** (e.g., Ukraine, Moldova, depending on the insurer)
  * Sometimes **Caucasus countries** like **Georgia**, **Armenia**, and **Azerbaijan**

So "Extended Europe" is a **marketing or practical term** used by insurers to indicate you're covered in **more countries than just the EU**.

#### When would "Extended Europe" be relevant?

* If you're traveling or driving beyond Scandinavia into **non-EU Eastern Europe** or **Turkey**
* If you want broader coverage that includes **less typical destinations** within Europe.



2. "World" signifies destinations outside of the European insurance coverage.
3. Some locations are categorized differently based on insurance policies.

This interface is designed to streamline airport gateway management efficiently and intuitively.
