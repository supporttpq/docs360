# Transport Stay Days

### Overview

Use **Transport Stay Days** to set up the stay lengths you sell.

Each row is one stay length. It has a **name** and a **number of days**.

### Why this matters

These stay lengths are used when you build trips and offers.

If everyone uses the same stay lengths, you avoid confusion. It also makes it easier to set up prices and rules.

### Where to find it

Go to **Setup → Transport Stay Days**.
