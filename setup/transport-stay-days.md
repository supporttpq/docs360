# Transport Stay Days

#### **Overview**

The **Transport Stay Days** page allows users to define and manage the possible durations of stay linked to transport arrangements. Each entry represents a combination of a **name** and the corresponding **number of days**, used when configuring transport offers or packages.

#### **Purpose**

This setup ensures that transport options automatically align with specific stay durations (e.g., weekend trips, one-week stays, or one-way transfers).\
It standardizes stay lengths across the system, providing consistency when creating or managing travel packages.

#### **Instructions**

**Accessing the Page**

Navigate to the **Transport Stay Days** section from the system’s setup or configuration area.
