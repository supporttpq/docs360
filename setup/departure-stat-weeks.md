# Departure stat weeks

A year can be defined per brand.

Note: If there is an interval set as "Default", a brand that does not have the interval defined will take the default one.

#### How to define? <a href="#how-to-define" id="how-to-define"></a>

* Select the agency - The agency is selected from the upper right drop-down.
* Year Value - Complete the year.
* Set as default interval - This option is not mandatory.
* Define Start / End Period - This option is not mandatory. If checked, it will define the year starting with the first date until the last date (last date will be the first day of the last week)

For example:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (23).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In this case, the first week will be:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (24).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

And the last week:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (25).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
