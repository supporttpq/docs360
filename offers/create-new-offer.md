# Create new offer

### Overview

The **Customer Offer** feature lets you create a personalized travel proposal that you can send to a customer (or prospect). An offer typically contains **transport + hotel**, optional **upsells**, and a message to the customer.

You can create an offer in two ways:

* From **Office Management → New Offer**
* While creating a **New Booking**, by opening the **Select Offer** popup

### Purpose

Use customer offers to:

* Build and send travel proposals to **existing customers** or **new prospects**.
* Compare multiple travel options before creating a booking.
* Propose relevant add-ons (upsells) and communicate clearly with the customer.

***

### Before you start

* You need access to the **Offers** module.
* At minimum, you need the recipient’s:
  * **First name**
  * **Email address**

{% hint style="info" %}
In Tourpaq, a prospect who is not yet created as a customer is often called an **offeree**.
{% endhint %}

***

### Create an offer (step-by-step)

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### 1) Open the Offer Builder

Choose one of the following:

* **Office Management → New Offer**
* **New Booking → Select Offer** (opens the Offer Builder)
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### 2) Select the recipient (customer/offeree)

You can create an offer for:

* **Existing customer**: search and select the customer in the system
* **Offeree (new prospect)**: enter the details manually

**Mandatory fields**:

* **First name**
* **Email address**
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### 3) Enter travel search criteria

Fill in the travel criteria you want to search on:

* **Trip type** (for example, _Charter trips_ — depending on your setup)
* **Passengers**
  * Number of adults
  * Number of children and **their ages**
* **Departure airport**
* **Arrival airport**
  * Optional: narrow down by **resort** or **hotel**
* **Dates**
  * Choose a specific date, or a date interval
* Optional: **travel length** (stay duration)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Passenger ages affect availability and pricing. If a price looks wrong, double-check the children’s ages first.
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### 4) Search, filter, and select a proposal

1. Click **Search** to show matching options.
2. Use the results filters to narrow down by:
   * **Transport**
   * **Hotel**

{% hint style="info" %}
When you select a specific **transport**, the list of available **hotel rooms** is filtered to only show rooms that match that transport and passenger setup.
{% endhint %}

After selecting an option, review the offer details and price breakdown:

* **Total basket amount** (total price)
* **Trip details** (dates, duration, passenger setup)
* **Price specification** (adult/child prices, discounts, totals)

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (223).png" alt="Offer details and price specification"><figcaption><p>Review travel details and the price specification before sending.</p></figcaption></figure>

If you need a different option, you can typically:

* Search again with different **dates** or **departure airports**
* Adjust the **passenger configuration**
* Show/hide details to focus on the items you need
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### 5) Add upsells (optional)

For many proposals, Tourpaq suggests relevant **upsell items** (add-ons).

You normally have two choices:

* **Include in basket**: adds the upsell to the offer price immediately
* **Propose as optional upgrade**: shows the upsell to the customer as an option, without changing the base offer total

Example:

* _Golfbag_ → included in basket (changes the total)
* _Meal Flight_ → proposed as optional upgrade (does not change the base total)

After you decide:

1. Click **Update Price**
2. Save the offer/basket changes

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### 6) Add comments and finalize the offer

Use **Offer Comments** to add an explanation for the customer (for example, why you recommend this hotel, what’s included, or what alternatives you can offer).

{% hint style="info" %}
Offer Comments are a good place to add a short summary in plain language—especially for new customers.
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### 7) Send the offer to the customer

1. Review the email content (hotel/resort, travel dates, trip summary, and total amount).
2. Send the offer.

What happens after sending:

* A **success confirmation** appears.
* The system logs the **email sent date**.
* If **self-booking** is enabled for your setup, the customer email includes a **Booking** button/link.

{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

***

### After sending (follow-up and updates)

From the offers overview you can:

* Find the offer again using filters (customer, email, dates, status)
* Update details if the customer requests changes
* Track status and follow-up

See:

* [Offers](./)
* [Offer management and statistics](offer-management-and-statistics.md)

***

### Best practices

* Confirm **passenger ages** before sending (pricing depends on it).
* Use **optional upsells** to increase value without changing the base price.
* Write short, clear text in **Offer Comments** (what is included, why you recommend it, and next steps).
* If you create multiple options, keep them in one proposal/basket so you can compare before sending.

### FAQ

<details>

<summary><strong>What is an “offeree”?</strong></summary>

An **offeree** is a prospect who is not yet created as a customer in Tourpaq. You can still send an offer as long as you enter (at minimum) a **first name** and **email address**.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Why do hotel room options change when I select a transport?</strong></summary>

Tourpaq filters hotel room results to match the selected **transport**, dates, and passenger setup. This helps ensure you only see combinations that are actually available.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Why is the price incorrect?</strong></summary>

In most cases, pricing issues come from passenger setup—especially **children’s ages**. Re-check:

* number of adults/children/infants
* children’s ages
* travel dates and travel length

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>What’s the difference between “Include in basket” and “Optional upgrade”?</strong></summary>

* **Include in basket** adds the upsell to the offer total immediately.
* **Optional upgrade** proposes the add-on to the customer without changing the base offer total.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Where can I see if an offer was sent?</strong></summary>

Open the offer and look for the **email sent date**. You can also locate it from the [Offers](./) list using filters like customer email, status, or created period.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>How long is an offer valid and when should I follow up?</strong></summary>

Offer availability and follow-up timing depends on your company setup (default availability days and follow-up days). See [Offer management and statistics](offer-management-and-statistics.md) for details.
