# Offer management and statistics

Once an offer has been sent, the customer has a certain amount of time until the offer expires.&#x20;

Also, the sales agent has a certain amount of time to follow up on this offer. These intervals can be set in the company system set up by using these to fields The default offer availability days and the default offer follow-up days.&#x20;

On each offer, these dates are being set automatically. They can also be adjusted manually if needed. An offer that is near its follow-up or expiration date appears on the Tourpaq dashboard, so the sales agent has the possibility to manage it more easily. The end goal for any offer proposal is being transformed into a booking order. Or it can be closed with a certain reason.&#x20;

One booking option is for the customer to place the booking himself using the web booking link in the email.&#x20;

The other option is for the sales agent to place the booking with the office admin.&#x20;

In the office, the booking will be prefilled with the transport and hotel details as well as customer information.&#x20;

Taking allotment is very simple now. The offer will not appear on the dashboard anymore since it has reached the desired goal. The offer listing now shows the offer as being transformed into a booking order.&#x20;

In the offer management page, you can either export or filter by various criteria. You can filter by customer first or last name, by customer type, by email address, by current offer status, if closed by a closing reason, by follow-up interval, and by create interval.&#x20;

The **Export Offers** functionality allows users to extract and download a list of offers from the system into a file format (e.g., Excel or CSV). This provides an efficient way to analyze, share, or archive offer data outside of the platform.

### Purpose

Exporting offers ensures that users can:

* Generate reports for internal or external use.
* Perform further analysis in spreadsheet tools.
* Share filtered offers with colleagues or customers.
* Keep a local backup of offer data.

### Preconditions

* The user must have access to the **Offers** module.
* Filters (optional) should be set if only a subset of offers needs to be exported.
* Export permissions must be granted by the system administrator (if applicable).

### Instructions

1. Navigate to the **Offers** page.
2. Apply any desired filters (e.g., by customer name, email, or creation period).
3. Click on the **three-dot menu** in the top-right corner of the page.
4. Select **Export** from the dropdown menu.
5. The system will generate a file containing the offers based on the applied filters.
6. Save the file to your local device.

### Notes

* If no filters are applied, the system will export **all available offers**.
* Exported files typically include columns such as Offer No., Brand, Customer Type, Phone, Email, Create User, Create Date, Update Date, Status, and Status details
* File format may vary depending on system configuration (Excel/CSV).

We also have the possibility to view statistics of all these offers per each sales agent. In here you will see only the sent offers and the success rate a sales agent has.
