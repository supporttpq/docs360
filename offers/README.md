# Offers

### Overview

The **Offers** page is your overview of all **customer offers** in Tourpaq.

An _offer_ is a proposed travel package you can send to a customer (or prospect), follow up on, and—if accepted—convert into a booking.

On this page you can:

* **Find** offers quickly using search and filters
* **Open** an offer to review or update it
* **Track** the offer status (sent, expired, sold, etc.)
* **Plan follow-ups** using the follow-up date
* **Create** a new offer
* Switch to **Statistics** for an aggregated view

***

### Purpose

Use the Offers overview to keep your sales work organized:

* Retrieve offers based on customer, dates, destination/hotel, creator, and more
* See what needs follow-up and when
* Keep internal notes so colleagues understand what has been done

***

### Before you start

* You must have access to the **Offers** module in Tourpaq Office.
* Offers can be created manually by an agent or through integrated customer interactions.
* Customer and travel data should exist in the system to make filtering effective.

### Find offers (filters)

Use the filters at the top of the page to narrow down the list.

#### Common filters

* **First name / Last name**: Find offers by customer name.
* **Email**: Find offers by customer email.
* **Offer no**: Open a specific offer if you know the offer number.
* **Created period (From / To)**: Show offers created in a specific date range.
* **Departure date / Arrival date**: Filter by the travel dates in the offer.
* **Status**: Show offers in a specific state (for example _Unsent_, _Available_, _Expired_, _Sold_, _Closed_).
* **Follow-up start date / Follow-up end date**: Show offers that have a follow-up scheduled in a given period.
* **Create user**: Show offers created by a specific user.
* **Hotel**: Show offers that include a specific hotel.

#### Other options

* **Close reason**: Filter closed offers based on why they were closed.
* **Customer type**: Filter by who the offer is for (for example **Customer** vs **Offeree**).
* **Display names**: Toggle between showing internal system names vs display names (if available in your setup).
* **More filters**: Expand additional filter options for a more detailed search.

#### Apply or reset filters

* Click **Display** to apply your selected filters.
* Click **Clear** to reset all filters and show all results.

### Understand the offer list

Each row in the list is one offer. The most important fields are:

* **Offer No**: The offer’s unique ID (click to open the offer).
* **Brand**: The brand the offer belongs to.
* **Type**: Who the offer is for (typically **Customer** or **Offeree**).
* **Customer/Offeree**: Name of the person receiving the offer.
* **Create User / Create Date**: Who created the offer and when.
* **Update User / Update Date**: Who last updated the offer and when.
* **Follow-up Date**: The next planned contact date.
* **Status**: Current state of the offer.
* **Status Details**: Extra information (for example “Not sent to customer” or “Expired on \[date]”).
* **Internal Comment**: Internal notes (only visible to office users).

#### Offer statuses (most common)

* **Unsent**: Offer is created but not sent to the customer yet.
* **Available**: Offer is active and can be sent/used.
* **Expired**: Offer validity has ended.
* **Sold**: Offer has been accepted and converted into a booking.
* **Closed**: Offer has been closed (check **Close reason** when relevant).

#### Delete an offer

A delete icon may be available on each row.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Deleting an offer removes it from the list. Only delete offers if your company process allows it and you are sure it is no longer needed.
{% endhint %}

***

### Actions

* **Create**: Start a new offer.
* **Offers / Statistics**: Switch between the offers list and an aggregated statistics view (for example number of offers sent and conversion rates).
