# Offer template

### Overview

An **Offer Template** defines the **layout and branded content** used when Tourpaq sends an offer to a customer (typically by email, and depending on your setup sometimes also as a printable document/PDF).

Offer templates help your team send offers that are consistent, easy to read, and aligned with your brand.

{% hint style="info" %}
Offer templates are often customized per agency/brand. Your installation may look slightly different if your template was custom-built.

### Purpose

Use offer templates to:

* Ensure customers receive a **clear and professional** offer email
* Keep **branding and standard texts** consistent across the team
* Combine system data (hotel, dates, passengers, price) with **friendly explanatory text**

***

### Before you start

* You need access to the **Offers** module.
* Template texts (header/footer, insurance texts, etc.) are typically configured per **Brand**.

To manage the texts and images used in offers, see:

* [Select text for Offers](select-text-for-offers.md)

### What the customer offer email typically contains

Below are the most common sections you will see in a customer offer email.

#### 1) Brand header (intro)

A branded header usually contains your standard greeting/introduction.

* Some templates support placeholders (dynamic fields). In some setups, you can add a dynamic **Message** variable.

#### 2) Personal message to the customer

This is the part you adjust per customer (for example: “Here are the best options based on your request…”).

#### 3) Your agency’s benefits / selling points

Many templates include a short section describing why the customer should book with your agency (support, security, flexibility, etc.).

#### 4) Offer or hotel comments (per offer option)

If the offer email includes multiple options (different hotels/rooms/dates), you can typically add a **comment per option**.

Use this to explain:

* why you recommend a specific hotel/room
* what is included
* important conditions the customer should notice

#### 5) Trip summary and price

Most templates include:

* Resort/hotel details
* Stay dates and duration
* A price summary (and what is included)

#### 6) Optional extras (upsells)

Templates often include a section showing what can be added (for example transfers, baggage, seat upgrades, activities, etc.).

#### 7) Insurance information (if enabled)

If your brand setup includes insurance texts/links, the offer email can show travel and/or cancellation insurance information.

#### 8) Brand footer

The footer usually contains standard contact information, disclaimers, and a signature.

### Field / element descriptions (common)

These are common elements you may see when working with offer templates and customer offers:

* **Offer Template Name**: The name of the template/layout (branding and structure).
* **Customer**: The person receiving the offer.
* **Travel dates**: The departure and return dates (or start/end of stay).
* **Services included**: What the offer contains (transport, hotel, extras).
* **Pricing breakdown**: How the price is built up (base price, additions, discounts).
* **Comments / follow-up**: Notes, explanations, and the internal follow-up date.
* **Status**: Where the offer is in the workflow (for example _Unsent_, _Available_, _Expired_, _Sold_, _Closed_).
* **Send / Generate**: Actions for sending the offer (and in some setups generating a PDF/print view).
* **Conversion to booking**: The option/workflow used when the customer accepts and the offer becomes a booking.

***

### Best practices

* Keep the **personal message** short and clear:
  * what you propose
  * why you propose it
  * what the customer should do next
* Use **offer/hotel comments** to highlight important details (location, room type, special conditions).
* Ensure **insurance text** is correct and compliant for your market.
* Review the offer email regularly (especially after branding changes).

{% hint style="info" %}
If you need to change standard texts (header/footer/insurance/extras descriptions), those are normally managed in the brand offer text settings. See [Select text for Offers](select-text-for-offers.md).
