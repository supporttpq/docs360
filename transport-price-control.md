# Transport Price Control

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** To have results listed according to the filters set, make sure departure stat weeks are defined for the year(s) used. See here how: [Departure stat weeks](setup/departure-stat-weeks.md)

### **Overview**

The **Transport Price Control** screen is a reporting and monitoring tool that provides detailed statistics about transport bookings, occupancy, load factors, and profitability. It helps users analyze transport performance over time and supports decision-making on pricing, capacity, and route adjustments.

### **Purpose**

The purpose of this screen is to:

* Track booking activity within a defined period.
* Monitor demand, occupancy, and load factor across different transports and hotels.
* Identify variations in performance (e.g., load factor changes, web clicks/views, profitability).
* Support pricing decisions by comparing booking trends, views/clicks, and revenue contribution.

### **Preconditions**

Before using the **Transport Price Control** tool:

1. Ensure that bookings and departures exist within the selected timeframe.
2. Departure statistics must be available from the relevant agency or department.
3. Searches should cover valid transport periods (not older than 12 months).
4. User permissions must allow access to reporting and statistical data.

### **Instructions**

#### **Step 1: Set Filters**

Use the available filters at the top of the screen to refine the report:

* **Booking start / Booking end** â€“ Define the booking date range for the report.
* **Departure from / Departure to** â€“ Select the departure date range.
* **Arrival from / Arrival to** â€“ Filter by arrival location.
* **Views/Clicks start / Views/Clicks end** â€“ Set ranges for online activity (views/clicks).
* **Pax no** â€“ Search by passenger number.
* **User Owners / Transports / Hotels / Status** â€“ Use the **Edit** button to include or exclude specific elements.
* **All bookings** â€“ Select whether to display all bookings or apply a filter.

#### **Step 2: Apply Filters**

* After selecting the filters, click **Display** to generate the report.
* To adjust filters, click **More filters**.
* To reset filters, click **Clear**.

#### **Step 3: Review Results**

The report displays data in multiple tabs, including:

* **Capacity** â€“ Transport capacity statistics.
* **Regulation Rules** â€“ Applied business rules affecting transport.
* **Occupancy** â€“ Percentage of seats filled.
* **Vacancy** â€“ Remaining available capacity.
* **Load Factor / Variation** â€“ Measures of occupancy efficiency and changes.
* **Load Factor Variation %** â€“ Percentage variation in load factor over time.
* **WEB Views/Clicks/Pax** â€“ Online interest and conversion data.
* **Average Profit** â€“ Profit per booking/transport.
* **Single Transport Profit Flow** â€“ Profitability analysis for individual transports.

#### **Step 4: Interpret Results**

If no results are shown, the system provides a message indicating possible reasons:

* Missing departure statistics for the chosen period or agency.
* Selected departures exceed the 12-month range.
* No results match the applied filters.

### **Result**

Once filters are applied correctly, the system generates transport-related performance statistics that can be used for pricing optimization, performance analysis, and profitability assessment.
