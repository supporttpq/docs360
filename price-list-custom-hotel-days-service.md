# Price List Custom Hotel days Service

#### Overview

The **Price List Custom Hotel Days** feature allows the setup of hotel stays that are independent of a predefined transport package. Unlike standard price lists, this functionality provides flexibility for creating hotel-only stays or combinations that can be sold outside of fixed departure packages.

#### Purpose

The purpose of this feature is to:

* Enable agencies to sell **hotel-only stays** or **custom-configured nights**.
* Offer flexibility to customers who may not require a full transport + hotel package.
* Allow for tailored availability and pricing, independent of transport schedules.

#### **Profit Margin**

* The markup or profit value to be applied on top of the base room cost.
* **How it works:**
  * If **“Is Percent”** is checked → the number entered here is treated as a percentage (%).
    * Example: 15 means a **15% profit margin** will be added.
  * If **“Is Percent”** is not checked → the number is treated as a fixed amount.
    * Example: 15 means **15 units of currency** (e.g., 15 EUR) will be added.

***

#### **Is Percent (checkbox)**

* **Checked:** Profit margin is applied as a **percentage** of the room cost.
* **Unchecked:** Profit margin is applied as a **fixed amount**.
