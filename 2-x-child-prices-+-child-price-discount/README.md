# 2 x Child prices + Child price discount

The 2 child prices are enabled by the feature "Child Profit Margin". The feature is only available as a Super Administrator.

The child profit margin is the same for both children.

## Children price adjustment on 'Price List' page

#### **Overview**

The **Child Profit Margin** feature allows companies to manage and display separate profit margins for child prices in the _Price List_. This functionality provides enhanced flexibility in yield management, ensuring that child pricing aligns with the overall profitability goals set by the company.

The feature can only be activated by a **Super Administrator** and becomes visible for administrators after it is enabled at the company level.

***

#### **Feature Activation**

To enable the Child Profit Margin functionality, a Super Administrator accesses the company’s configuration in the **Companies** section and opens the **Feature Access** tab.\
Within the **Yield Management** category, the option **Child Profit Margin** is available. Once this option is activated and saved, it becomes applicable to the selected company.

After activation, the company’s Price List setup will include additional columns and configuration options related to child pricing.

#### **Behavior in the Price List**

When an administrator logs in and accesses the **Price List** page, the standard price display can be extended with additional columns specific to child pricing.\
By using the column visibility menu (available through the three-dot icon on the table header), administrators can enable the following options:

* **CHILD PRICES**
* **CHILD PRICES %**
* **CHILD PROFIT MARGIN**

Once selected, the Price List table displays new columns that correspond to child-related pricing data:

* **Price columns:** CH1P1, CH2P1
* **Percentage columns:** CH1%,
* **Profit margin columns:** CPM1

<div data-with-frame="true"><figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (450).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

These columns provide detailed insight into how child prices and profit margins are calculated and applied. Both child prices share the same profit margin, ensuring consistent calculations across different occupancy configurations.

#### **Purpose and Benefits**

The Child Profit Margin feature enhances transparency and control over child pricing strategies. It enables administrators to fine-tune child-related profit margins independently of adult prices, allowing for more accurate financial analysis and pricing optimization.

By exposing detailed pricing components in the _Price List_, partner administrators gain better visibility of how discounts, occupancy rules, and yield management settings impact child profitability.
