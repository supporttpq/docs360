# Add Weekly Activity

#### **Overview**

The **Weekly Activities** page displays all recurring events configured for each resort.\
These activities are initially defined from **Guest App → Weekly Activities** and can also be managed from this section by authorized users.\
Both **Admin** and **Guide Users** can view weekly activities depending on their resort access.

***

#### **Purpose**

The purpose of the **Weekly Activities** module is to:

* Manage and display recurring events across resorts (e.g., welcome meetings, tours, excursions).
* Allow authorized users to create, view, and update activities visible in the **Guest App**.
* Ensure guides only see activities relevant to their assigned resorts.
* Provide a clear overview of scheduled activities for easier coordination between staff and guests.

***

#### **User Access**

* **Admin Users** can view and manage all weekly activities across all agencies and resorts.
* **Guide Users** can only see weekly activities **if they have access to all the resorts assigned** to that specific activity.\
  This ensures that guides only manage events relevant to their operational area.

***

#### **Add Weekly Activity**

When clicking **Create**, the **Add Weekly Activity** form opens.\
This is where a user can define all parameters of the new weekly activity.

#### **Example**

In the example above, an activity titled **“Christmas Season”** is configured as follows:

* **Start Date:** 01-12-2025
* **End Date:** 31-12-2025
* **Day of Week:** Saturday
* **Time:** 18:00
* **Resorts:** Multiple selected
* **Hotels:** All selected
* **Description:** Visit Romania

This means the activity will be visible in the Guest App every Saturday in December 2025 for the selected resorts and hotels.

#### **Relation to Guest App → Weekly Activities**

The data created or edited in this section is synchronized with the **Guest App → Weekly Activities** module.\
Guests can view these activities in their app during their stay, based on their resort and hotel selection.\
Guide Users can also access these activities in their own interface if they have permission for the associated resorts.
