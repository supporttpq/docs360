# Scheduled Activity

#### **Overview**

The **Scheduled Activity** tab allows users to configure recurring or one-time activities for specific hotels and dates within a selected time range.\
It provides more granular control compared to **Weekly Activity**, as each day of the week can have its own configuration ‚Äî such as different times or service phone availability.

This tab is typically used to plan and display activities or service phone hours visible in the **Guest App** for guests staying in those hotels.

#### **Purpose**

The purpose of the **Scheduled Activity** configuration is to:

* Define daily service or activity schedules for selected hotels.
* Allow flexible per-day setup within a given date range.
* Support guide and customer service visibility in the **Guest App**.
* Synchronize service availability and timing for different resorts and hotels.
