# Weekly Activities

#### **Overview**

The **Weekly Activities** page provides an overview of all recurring activities configured for different resorts.\
These activities are defined from **Guest App → Weekly Activities** and can also be viewed by **Guide Users** who have access to the assigned resorts.\
Each record shows when and where a weekly activity takes place, helping agencies and guides coordinate resort events efficiently.

#### **Purpose**

The purpose of the **Weekly Activities** page is to:

* Display all recurring activities set up in the **Guest App → Weekly Activities** section.
* Allow **Admin** and **Guide Users** to view, manage, and maintain a clear schedule of weekly events.
* Provide a structured overview of activities (e.g., welcome meetings, excursions) for each resort and hotel.
* Support consistent communication of activities to guests through the Guest App.

#### **User Access**

* The page can be accessed by both **Admin** and **Guide Users**.
* A **Guide User** can only see a weekly activity if they have access to **all the resorts** assigned to that specific activity.\
  This ensures guides only view and manage events relevant to their assigned destinations.

#### **Example Use Case**

A **Guide User** in Tenerife creates a _Welcome Meeting_ that takes place every Monday at 10:00 between _01-11-2025_ and _31-03-2026_.\
Because the guide has access to all resorts linked to this activity, it will appear both in the **Weekly Activities** list and the **Guest App** for guests staying in those hotels.
