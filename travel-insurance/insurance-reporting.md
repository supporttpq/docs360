The insurances will be reported based on the communication type:

* Days before/after departure – Insurance is reported to the company x days before or after the departure date:
  * A value of 0 means the insurance will be reported on the departure date.
  * A value of "-1" means the insurance will be reported 1 day before the departure date.
  * A value of "1" means the insurance will be reported 1 day after the departure date.
* Days after deposit paid date - insurances are reported to the company x days after the deposit is paid.

Another means of controlling the reporting of insurances is from the booking, **Passenger details** tab.

The insurance will be reported on the specified date.

**When there is a date set in the passenger details for the insurance, as well as the details filled in the brands section for insurances, insurances will be reported using the earliest filter**

Example 1: Booking is leaving on 09.06.2025. Insurances are set to be reported 1 day before departure. In **Passenger details** tab, date is set for 08.06.2025. Reporting date for this booking is 08.06.2025.

Example 2: Same booking. Insurances are set to be reported 7 days before departure. In **Passenger details** tab, date is set for 07.06.2025. Reporting date for this booking is 02.06.2025
