# Extra package

The package tab contains an unlimited number of extras (marked as package extra). The user can also set the booking rule: Choices are “Select all” or “Select minimum X and maximum Y”.

Extras that are included in any kind of package are marked as **Package extra**.

To use an **Extra Package**, first Extras have to be assigned as **Content type** extras. After a desired number of extras have been assigned as **Content type** extras, a new extra has to be created and assigned as a **Package type** extra.
