# Individual per transport direction

This feature allows the addition of one or more extras for passengers, independently, on the outbound flight or only on the return flight. (Baggage is one example; it could be 20 kg of baggage outbound and 30 kg of baggage homebound).

An extra will have the possibility to be ordered only for one direction. This will be supported in the whole system:

* In the booking flow
* In Webbooking
* In reports
* In cost reports (profit pages, finance)

All Extras of a specific category will have the out/home functionality, so this it will be needed to be configured on the Extras category level. After an extra category is created , a new checkbox appear on the Settings menu. This is called Out/Home and is used for individual transports, to distinguish between out and home products.
