# Sold out behaviour

**Sold out** behaviour for extras can be set from the Extra category and is available only for products with allotment.

To better exemplify this, we have the next case:

Allotmets: 4

Passengers : 6

In this case, if all passengers what to book the allotment the fifth passenger will see product greyed out, unable to be selected and with "Sold out" in it description.

If there is no allotment available from the start, a message appears in the category description, along with the other warnings on the product.
