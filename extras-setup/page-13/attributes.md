### **Overview**

This page provides details on how to configure and manage attributes for the extra product. The attributes section allows users to assign specific tags or labels that describe or influence how the product behaves or is displayed across brands.

### **Navigation Path**

**Menu > Product > Extra > Attributes Tab**

Users can choose one or more of the attributes defined in the [Extras Attributes](../../extras-attributes.md).

An attribute will appear automatically on the Ticket and in Customer Centre. It allows the guests to influence the behaviour of the extra or select a product that fits them. (Example: A Sky equipment product can have an attribute with the height of the guest so that the suppliers or the agency can know what lenght the sky equipment will be needed for the guest).

Hotel Lists, Extra Lists and Vouchers will also display the attribute if they are selected.

User can select start day from drop-down list, in Edit Passenger for a certain booking, if the extras has an attribute for this already defined and Extras has in Prices, at field Days, a number of days defined.

More information can be found in [Extras Attributes](../../extras-attributes.md).

### **Attributes Section**

The _Attributes_ tab displays all current tags or characteristics assigned to the product.

#### **Fields:**

* **Attributes**: Displays the current attribute(s) applied. In this example, the attribute is:\
  &#xNAN;**â†’ Birthday**\
  This could relate to special configurations, offers, or logic specific to birthday-related services.
* **Edit Button**: Click this button to open the attribute editor and modify existing attributes or add new ones.
* **Automatically Select Default Attribute Value**:\
  A checkbox that, when enabled, will automatically apply a default value for the attribute during usage (e.g., during booking or offer creation).
