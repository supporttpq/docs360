# Notes

#### 1. Overview

The Notes section is an internal communication and information storage module within the Tourpaq reservation management system. It is located as the final tab in the secondary configuration menu for an "Extra" product (in this case, the 20kg Baggage SKU).

#### 2. Purpose

The primary role of this field is to provide additional context for the operational or support teams managing add-on products. Unlike other fields that automatically populate travel documents or the public website, the Notes section is intended for:

* Internal Clarifications: Documenting specific operational conditions or provider rules.
* Change Logs: Recording why certain settings (like price or allotment) were modified.
* Team Instructions: Providing guidance for other departments on how to handle this Extra during cancellations or manual re-bookings.

#### 3. Field Breakdown & Instructions

Based on the interface shown in the image, here is how to navigate and use this section:

**A. Product Identification (Header)**

* Product Name: `20kg Bagage inkl max 5kg håndbagage`
* System Code: `XBAG_JTD_S_20KG`
* Instruction: Before entering a note, always verify you are on the correct SKU. Codes starting with `XBAG` are specifically reserved for baggage-related services.

**B. Brands Context**

Above the notes field, you will see various brand divisions (e.g., _Tourpaq DK_, _Tourpaq SE_, _Tourpaq Live_).

* Status Indicators: For example, "For sale+Int" on _Tourpaq DK_ means the product is active for that specific market.
* Instruction: Since the Notes field is generally global for this SKU, if your comment only applies to one brand (e.g., only for the Swedish market), clearly specify the brand name at the beginning of your text.

**C. The "Enter notes..." Text Area**

* Input Type: Free-form text.
* Usage Instructions:
  1. Be Concise: Write clear, actionable information.
  2. Date & Signature: It is best practice to start every entry with the date and your initials (e.g., `[Jan 26, 2026 - CM] Note: ...`).
  3. Confidentiality: Do not enter sensitive passenger data here. This field is for product-level logistics, not individual customer issues.
  4. Save: Ensure you look for a "Save" or "Update" button (usually at the bottom or top right of the main page) after typing, as the text area may not auto-save.
