# Notes

### Overview

The **Notes** tab is an internal field for storing operational context and team communication for an **Extra** product.

You’ll typically find it as the last tab in the Extra’s configuration.

{% hint style="info" %}
Notes are **internal only**. They do not populate the website, offers, tickets, or other customer-facing documents.
{% endhint %}

### When to use Notes

Use Notes to add context that helps colleagues understand **what was changed** and **why**.

Common use cases:

* **Internal clarifications**: Provider rules, operational constraints, or exceptions.
* **Change log**: Why a price, resource, or allotment was changed.
* **Team instructions**: What to do during cancellations, re-bookings, or manual handling.
