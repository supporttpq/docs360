# Extra package

**Overview**\
The _Extra Package_ functionality allows users to group multiple extras together into a single package. Each package can include an unlimited number of extras and can have booking rules defining how many of those extras a customer must or can select.

**Purpose**\
This feature helps agencies create bundled offers and manage extras more efficiently. It ensures flexibility in how extras are sold — whether all items in a package are mandatory or only a specific number of them are required — enhancing both operational control and customer experience.

The package tab contains an unlimited number of extras (marked as package extra). The user can also set the booking rule: Choices are “Select all” or “Select minimum X and maximum Y”.

Extras that are included in any kind of package are marked as **Package extra**.

To use an **Extra Package**, first Extras have to be assigned as **Content type** extras. After a desired number of extras have been assigned as **Content type** extras, a new extra has to be created and assigned as a **Package type** extra.

&#x20;A new tab, **Package content**, will appear. In this tab, the extras marked as **Content type** can be selected to be included in the package.

**Example**\
If a “Wellness Package” includes “Spa Access,” “Massage,” and “Sauna Entry”:

* Set these three as **Content Type Extras**.
* Create a new extra called **Wellness Package** and assign it as **Package Type Extra**.
* In the **Package Content** tab, include the three extras and choose the booking rule, e.g., _Select minimum 2 and maximum 3._
