# Teetime

### **Overview**

\
The _TeeTime_ functionality allows administrators to define time-based availability schedules for specific products—typically those that need hourly or daily booking slots, such as golf tee times, spa appointments, or guided tours. TeeTimes can be configured as regular products in **Extras Setup → Extras**, but they use a **Generic Allotment Type**, which enables advanced scheduling and slot control.

### **Purpose**

\
TeeTime helps agencies manage products that depend on time availability by:

* Defining exact booking intervals and durations.
* Controlling the number of guests or bookings per slot.
* Managing allotments dynamically (daily or weekly).
* Automatically calculating prices through the **Generic Product Price Rule**.

This ensures that availability is accurately reflected for both back-office users and customers booking through the web or mobile app.

**How to Use**

**1. Create a TeeTime Product**

1. Go to **Extras Setup → Extras**.
2. Create a new extra as usual.
3. In the **Allotment Type** field, select **Generic Allotment Type**.\
   This enables the TeeTime-specific settings listed below.

**TeeTime Settings:**

* **Pax limit** – Maximum number of products a guest can book in total.
* **Limit per day** – Maximum number of products a guest can book per day.
* **Limit before hour** – Restricts booking availability before a specific time.
* **Latitude / Longitude** – Used to calculate sunrise and sunset times for displaying in Office or on the web.
* **Product Parent ID** – Used to link products that share the same allotment across multiple companies.

### Prices <a href="#prices" id="prices"></a>

Teetime products draw their cost and price from **Generic Product Price Rule**, any value inserted in the Price tab will be disregarded. But a price line is required to enable the product to be sold. The priceline should look like this:

It is similar with the seating setting.

Real price of the product is set in **Extras Setup/Generic Product Price Rule**.

TeeTimes products appear in the **Tee Time Extras Lists**.

For this to work, the product needs to have a supplier assigned. The supplier cannot block the allotment of a TeeTime if he doesn't have the rights to do so, but he also has access to the lists

### Special settings <a href="#special-settings" id="special-settings"></a>

**Generic Allotment**

The TeeTime allotment defines when and how often the product is available.

**Daily Allotments**

* **Frequency** – Number of days in the recurring availability pattern.
* **Daily Frequency** – Defines when during the day bookings can be made:
  * At specific fixed times, or
  * Every _X_ minutes within a defined hourly range.
* **Duration** – Total time span during which the product is available (e.g., 09:00–18:00).
* **Allotment** – Number of available items per slot (e.g., if set to 4 and frequency is 30 minutes, 4 slots open every 30 minutes).

**Example:**\
If the product is available every 30 minutes between 09:00–19:00 with an allotment of 4, there will be 20 available slots per day (one every 30 minutes).

### Weekly allotments <a href="#weekly-allotments" id="weekly-allotments"></a>

The only change from **Daily allotments** is

* Frequency - this time it is in weeks and not days, with the additional selection of days of the week in which the product is available

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (148).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* If **All Days** is checked, allotments are created for the entire week.
  * When a guest departs midweek, only the first valid day of the allotment will be shown in the Guest App.\
    &#xNAN;_(Example: if allotment is generated for the whole week and the departure is on Tuesday → only Tuesday’s slots appear.)_

### Block allotments <a href="#block-allotments" id="block-allotments"></a>

The _Block Allotments_ feature allows admins to temporarily **block or unblock** availability for a defined date and time range.\
Use this when certain days or hours should not be bookable (e.g., maintenance, private events, holidays)

**Result:**\
Once configured, TeeTime products follow the defined schedule and appear in the _TeeTime Extras Lists_. Booking availability and pricing are automatically handled by the system based on the configured rules and linked suppliers.
