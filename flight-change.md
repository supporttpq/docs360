# Flight change

A flight change is automatically generated when:

* The departure or arrival time is edited
* The flight number is changed

The flight change is identified as Tiny, Small, and Large depending on the flight time adjustments. The intervals are configurable.

The flight change is also identified as sooner or later, depending on the amount of time adjusted. A 10-minute delay is classified as tiny later.

The flight change is queued in a flight change system, and they are manually released or dropped.

If the same flight is changed twice, then two flight changes are queued for the same flight, and it is a manual process to delete one of the flight changes.

The flight change system gives an overview of destination/flight changes, and there are several filtering possibilities.

When a flight change is submitted to a guest (this is a carefully designed mail), the user can click a link to confirm the receipt.

If the user fails to confirm the receipt, the system will resend the flight change a couple of times and then try with an SMS asking the user to check mail and confirm.

In the flight change system, it is straightforward to see which guests have not yet confirmed the receipt of the flight change.

If the guest fails to respond to the flight change, then the flight change is forwarded to a service mail that can take proper action (call the passenger, etc.).
