# Dynamic Email - Upload Image

### Overview

You can add images directly inside a **Dynamic Email**. This helps make your message easier to read.

You can either:

* upload an image from your computer, or
* use an image that is already online.

### **Purpose**

Uploading and inserting an image ensures that email content is more engaging and visually informative. This functionality supports both image uploads from the local device and the use of existing online image URLs.

#### 4. Use an image from the internet (optional)

If the image is already online:

1. Open the **Image Info** tab.
2. Paste the image address into the **URL** field.
3. Click **OK**.

Use a direct link to the image file, not a web page link.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

If you upload an image once, you can reuse it later with **Browse Server**.

### FAQ

<details>

<summary>What image address should I use for an online image?</summary>

Use a direct image link. It often ends with `.jpg`, `.png`, or `.gif`.

A link to a web page usually will not work.

<summary>I clicked “Send it to the Server”, but nothing happens. What should I do?</summary>

Try again and wait a few seconds.

If it still fails, try a smaller image or a different file.

<summary>Why can’t I find my image under “Browse Server”?</summary>

The upload may not have finished.

Check that you saw **File Uploaded**, then open **Browse Server** again.

<summary>Why does the image not show up for some recipients?</summary>
