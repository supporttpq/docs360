# Dynamic E-mail/SMS Center

This feature allows the sending of e-mails and sms to bookings based on specific requirements using a wide range of filters like:

* date filters
* destination filters
* products that have been bought or not

It can be used to notify the guests of their departure date, to welcome them to the trip location, to welcome them home, to make them aware of certain products they can book etc.

### Dynamic E-mail vs Dynamic SMS <a href="#dynamic-e-mail-vs-dynamic-sms" id="dynamic-e-mail-vs-dynamic-sms"></a>

A Dynamic E-mail template has more option than a Dynamic SMS, not to mention that you can write more characters, as the Dynamic SMS lacks the body part of the message and the only information that will reach the guest is the one inserted in the Subject text case.

**Caution!!**

* An e-mail or SMS template that has been sent to a booking cannot be resent.
* Please be carefull when creating a template. If mistakes are made during the creation of a template, editing is not advised, since a booking cannot receive more than on e-mail or SMS from 1 template.
