# Ticket Attachments

### **Overview**

The **Ticket Attachments** page is used to manage PDF documents that are automatically attached to tickets sent via email. This feature ensures that agencies can provide passengers with relevant conditions and supplementary information for each booking.

### **Access**

* Path: **E-mail Setup â†’ Ticket Attachments**
* Note: The page is **agency-specific**, meaning the agency must be selected before making changes.

### **Purpose**

* Allows agencies to attach specific **conditions PDF documents** to tickets.
* Ensures compliance and provides clear communication to travelers.
* Supports different attachment rules depending on the transport type.

### **Transport Type Tabs**

The feature includes **five tabs**, each corresponding to a transport type:

1. **All Transports**
   * Documents applied to **all types of transports**, regardless of category.
2. **Charter Transports**
   * For transports defined using **Fix Quotas** for flights.
   * Attachments apply specifically to charter flights.
3. **Dynamic Transports**
   * For transports that use **Dynamic Itineraries**.
   * Itineraries may include **real transports** or **external providers (GDS)**.
4. **System Transports**
   * Generated from a **Transport Rule**.
   * At least one of the itinerary legs uses an **external provider (GDS)**.
5. **Sys-real Transports**
   * Generated from a **Transport Rule**.
   * Both itinerary legs use **real transports**.

### **Usage Notes**

* Attachments must be uploaded as **PDF files**.
* Agencies can define **different documents per transport type**, ensuring passengers receive the correct terms and conditions.
* Attachments are automatically included when tickets are generated and sent.
