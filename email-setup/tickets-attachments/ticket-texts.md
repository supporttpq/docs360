# Ticket texts

### **Overview**

In addition, administrators can configure specific texts that will be automatically included on printed tickets generated during the booking process.

### **Purpose**

* Ensure that customers receive **timely SMS notifications** related to their bookings.
* Provide agencies with the ability to **customize printed tickets** by attaching specific texts to defined booking conditions (e.g., booking period, room type).
* Maintain consistency and accuracy of communication with customers.

### **Administrator Capabilities**

Administrators can perform the following actions on this page:

* **Use an existing text template** – Apply predefined ticket texts to bookings.
* **Edit an existing text** – Modify the content, dates, or conditions of a stored ticket text.
* **Insert a new text** – Create and configure a new text to be used in tickets.
* **Delete a text** – Remove a text that is no longer relevant or valid.

### **Ticket Text Attributes**

Each ticket text entry includes the following information:

* **Text Type** – The category or purpose of the text (e.g., information, terms & conditions, cancellation notes).
* **Identification Code**&#x20;
* **Date Interval**&#x20;
* **Text Content** – The actual message that will appear on the printed ticket.

### **Usage Example**

* A hotel agency wants to add a note about **seasonal resort fees**.
* The administrator creates a new ticket text, sets the **date interval** to cover the summer season, links it to the relevant **room type**, and enters the explanatory message.
* When bookings are confirmed for that room and date range, the message will be automatically included on the printed ticket.
