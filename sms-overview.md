#### **a) Search Filters**

Users can apply multiple filters to view sent messages:

* **SMS type** – Allows selection of the SMS type (e.g., confirmation, cancellation, payment notification).
* **Sent period** – Users can select a time range to filter SMS messages sent within that period.
* **Phone number** – Enables searching for SMS messages sent to a specific phone number.
* **Status** – Filters messages based on their status (e.g., sent, failed, delivered).
* **More Filters** – Provides access to additional filters for more detailed searches.
* **Clear** – Resets all active filters.
* **Display** – Displays the results based on the selected filters.

#### **b) SMS Listing Area**

Normally, this section would display a list of sent SMS messages with details such as:

* **Recipient phone number**
* **SMS type**
* **Sending date and time**
* **Message status (sent, failed, delivered, etc.)**

In the provided screenshot, no records are displayed, meaning no SMS messages match the applied filters.

### **Usage and Purpose**

1. **Monitoring Sent Messages**
   * Users can check if an SMS was successfully delivered or encountered errors.
2. **Managing Delivery Errors**
   * If an SMS was not delivered, the user can take corrective actions, such as manually resending it or verifying the phone number.
3. **Exporting Data**
   * If this functionality is available, users can download reports on sent SMS messages for further analysis.
