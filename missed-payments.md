The **Missed Payment Page** contains information about payments that were not successfully processed or recorded.

### **Filtering Options:**

* **Agency:** A dropdown menu allows the user to filter payments based on the agency responsible.
* **Payment method:** Another dropdown lets the user filter by the payment method used (e.g., credit card, bank transfer).
* **Payment start & Payment end:** Date fields to filter payments within a specific date range.
* **Show hidden:** A checkbox to potentially display payments that have been marked as hidden or archived.
* **Clear:** A button to reset the filter options.

### **Table Columns:**

* **ACTIONS:** Contains icons representing actions that can be performed on each payment record. From the visible icons, we can infer options like editing, viewing details, or possibly re-processing the payment.
* **PAYMENT NO:** A unique identifier for each payment.&#x20;
* **PAYMENT METHODS:** Indicates the payment method used. In the example, it's "CARD".
* **AMOUNT:** The value of the payment.
* **DEBITS: identifier** related to debits or transactions.
* **TRANSACTION CODE:** A unique code for the transaction.
* **STATUS CODE:** Indicates the current status of the payment. The example shows "Capture Completed", which implies the payment was initially authorized but might have failed during the final capture stage.
* **PAYMENT STATUS:** Provides a more descriptive status, which is "Capture Completed" in the example, mirroring the status code.
* **AGENCY:** The agency associated with the payment
* **CUSTOMER:** The customer is involved in the payment.
* **BOOKING#:** A booking or reference number.
* **PAYMENT DATE:** The date the payment was attempted.
* **REASON:** This column is empty in the example, but it likely would contain the reason for the payment failure.
