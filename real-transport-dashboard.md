# Real Transport Dashboard

#### Overview

The **Real Transport Dashboard** provides an overview of all active and historical flight operations within a selected period. It allows users to monitor transport activities by departure and arrival locations, visualize flight capacity, and check the current booking situation for each departure.

The dashboard displays key operational data, including flight numbers, routes, dates, allotments, sold and available seats, and scheduled departure/arrival times.

#### Purpose

This page is designed to support the transport and operation teams in managing and verifying flight movements. It helps ensure accurate planning of seat allotments, identifies flights with remaining capacity, and provides quick access to detailed flight information when needed.

By filtering by date range, departure, or arrival location, users can easily narrow down the list to focus on specific routes or time periods.
