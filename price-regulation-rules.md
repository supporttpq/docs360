* Setup Name of the rule.&#x20;
* Code for this rule,&#x20;
* Then specify the amount that you want the offer to increase with. If the specified offer numbers are sold within the number of hours you set.&#x20;
* You can also set a rule to have the price decreased if the specific offer numbers are not sold within the hour specified. Actually, you defined an amount to have the price up, and also you have the rule to have the price decreased.&#x20;
* You have lower limits for the price so you ensure that the price doesn't go below a specific limit. You can set different prices for each interval in the price list.&#x20;
