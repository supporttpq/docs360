# Vocabulary

In the VisitSun mobile application, the **Vocabulary** section displays a series of keywords that are intended to be used by guests during their vacation. These words are defined in Tourpaq Office via the **Guest App -> Vocabulary** section when logged in as a guide or admin. The keywords are shown in the application depending on the country where the guest is traveling.
