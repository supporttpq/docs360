# Flight change

#### **Overview**

The **Flight Change System** automatically detects and manages updates to flight details such as departure times, arrival times, and flight numbers. It ensures passengers are notified about flight modifications and provides tracking for unconfirmed notifications.

***

#### **Automatic Flight Change Generation**

A **flight change** is automatically created when any of the following occur:

* The **departure time** or **arrival time** is edited.
* The **flight number** is changed.

Each flight change is categorized by **magnitude** and **direction** based on the time adjustment.

| **Category**             | **Description**                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tiny / Small / Large** | Classification based on configurable time intervals.                                                                  |
| **Sooner / Later**       | <p>Indicates whether the flight was moved earlier or delayed.<br>Example: A 10-minute delay → <em>Tiny Later</em></p> |

***

#### **Queue Management**

* Each flight change is **queued** in the **Flight Change System**.
* Flight changes must be **manually released or dropped** by the user.
* If the **same flight is edited multiple times**, multiple flight changes are queued. The user must manually **delete duplicate entries**.

***

#### **Overview and Filtering**

The system provides a detailed **overview of destinations and flight changes**, with **multiple filtering options** to help users manage and locate specific updates easily.

***

#### **Guest Communication Process**

1. When a flight change is submitted, a **notification email** is sent to the guest.
   * The email contains a **confirmation link** for the guest to acknowledge the change.
2. If the guest **does not confirm receipt**, the system will:
   * **Resend the email** several times.
   * Then, **send an SMS reminder** asking the guest to check their email and confirm the change.
3. Within the system, it is easy to identify guests who **have not yet confirmed** receipt.
4. If no confirmation is received after multiple attempts, the flight change is **forwarded to a service email**, allowing the team to take further action (such as calling the passenger).

***

#### **Customer Outcome**

* Ensures **transparent communication** with passengers regarding flight schedule updates.
* Reduces **manual workload** by automating detection, notification, and follow-up processes.
* Enables **efficient tracking and intervention** when guests fail to confirm flight changes.
